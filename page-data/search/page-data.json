This change offers significant savings on bundle size. If your application needs to support older browsers such as IE 11, make sure to include  node_modules  in your babel config. Worker Concurrency Default number of worker threads for each loader has been reduced from  5  to  3  on non mobile devices and to  1  on mobile devices to reduce memory use. Generally, increasing the number of workers has diminishing returns. @loaders.gl/gltf GLTFScenegraph  is updated to provide modifying capabilities. Signatures of some methods have been changed to use named parameters (rather than positional parameters). The deprecated  GLBBuilder  class and  encodeGLTFSync  functions have now been removed. @loaders.gl/basis Module has been moved to  @loaders.gl/textures . @loaders.gl/images The texture API  loadImage ,  loadImageArray ,  loadImageCube  has been moved to the new  @loaders.gl/textures  module, and have been renamed to  loadImageTexture* . @loaders.gl/kml The  KMLLoader ,  GPXLoader , and  TCXLoader  now require a value for  options.gis.format . Previously, the lack of a value would return data in \"raw\" format, i.e. not normalized to GeoJSON. To return GeoJSON-formatted data, use  options.gis.format: 'geojson' . Other options are  binary  and  raw . The  kml.normalize  option has been deprecated. When  options.gis.format  is  geojson , coordinates will always be in longitude-latitude ordering. @loaders.gl/compression Sync transforms no longer supported (this enables dynamic library loading). Transform static members now named  run()  instead of  inflate()  and  deflate() . Zstandard transforms removed due to excessive bundle size impact. Use the new  ZstdWorker  object instead. @loaders.gl/crypto Sync hashing no longer supported (this enables dynamic library loading). Transform static members now named  run()  instead of  hash() . @loaders.gl/loader-utils createWorker()  now creates a generic worker. For loader workers use the new  createLoaderWorker()  function. Upgrading to v2.3 @loaders.gl/core : selectLoader()  is now async and returns a  Promise  that resolves to a loader. selectLoaderSync()  is available for situations when calling an async function is inconvenient. Passing  fetch  options to  load()  and  parse()  etc. should now be done via the  options.fetch  sub-options object. fetch options on the root object are now deprecated. @loaders.gl/kml : The  KMLAsGeoJsonLoader  has been removed, use  KMLLoader , with  options.gis.format: 'geojson' . Upgrading to v2.2 @loaders.gl/core selectLoader  is no longer experimental. If you were using the experimental export, replace  _selectLoader  with  selectLoader . Also note that argument order has changed and now aligns with  load  and  parse parseInBatchesSync  has been removed, all batched parsing is now performed asynchronously. Some iterator utilities that are mostly used internally have been changed. Function Replacement / Status makeChunkIterator combined into  makeIterator makeStreamIterator combined into  makeIterator textDecoderAsyncIterator makeTextDecoderIterator lineAsyncIterator makeLineIterator numberedLineAsyncIterator makeNumberedLineIterator getStreamIterator Deprecated in 2.1, now removed in 2.2 contatenateAsyncIterator Deprecated in 2.1, now removed in 2.2 @loaders.gl/csv Header auto-detection now requires  options.csv.header  to be set to  'auto'  instead of  undefined .  'auto'  is the new default value for this option, so this change is unlikely to affect applications. @loaders.gl/json The experimental  json._rootObjectBatches  option is now deprecated. Use the top-level  metadata: true  option instead. Note that the  batchType  names have also changed, see the JSONLoader docs for details. @loaders.gl/ply The experimental streaming  _PLYStreamingLoader  has been removed. Use the non-streaming  PLYLoader  instead. @loaders.gl/images The new function  getBinaryImageMetadata()  replaces  isBinaryImage() ,  getBinaryImageSize()  and  getBinaryImageMIMEType() . The old functions are now deprecated, but still available. Upgrading to v2.1 @loaders.gl/core Some iterator helper functions have been renamed, the old naming is now deprecated. Old Name New Name getStreamIterator makeStreamIterator contatenateAsyncIterator concatenateChunksAsync @loaders.gl/json Experimental exports have been removed  JSONParser ,  StreamingJSONParser ,  ClarinetParser . @loaders.gl/images The experimental ImageLoaders for individual formats introduced in 2.0 have been removed, use  ImageLoader  for all formats.\n @loaders.gl/images getImageData(image)  now returns an object with  {data, width, height}  instead of just the  data  array. This small breaking change ensures that the concept of  image data  is consistent across the API. ImageLoader :  options.image.type : The  html  and  ndarray  image types are now deprecated and replaced with  image  and  data  respectively. @loaders.gl/3d-tiles Tileset3DLoader  and  Tile3DLoader  are replaced by  Tiles3DLoader , which supports loading both a 3D tileset file and a tile. Check  loaders.gl/3d-tiles  for loaded data format. Upgrading to v2.0 Version 2.0 is a major release that consolidates functionality and APIs, and a number of deprecated functions have been removed. Some general changes: All exported loader and writer objects now expose a  mimeType  field. This field is not yet used by  @loaders.gl/core  but is available for applications (e.g. see  selectLoader ). All (non-worker) loaders are now required to expose a  parse  function (in addition to any more specialized  parseSync/parseText/parseInBatches  functions). This simplifies using loaders without  @loaders.gl/core , which can reduce footprint in small applications. @loaders.gl/core Removal Replacement TextEncoder Use global  TextEncoder  instead and  @loaders.gl/polyfills  if needed TextDecoder Use global  TextDecoder  instead and  @loaders.gl/polyfills  if needed createReadStream fetch().then(resp => resp.body) parseFile parse parseFileSync parseSync loadFile load @loaders.gl/images Removal Replacement ImageHTMLLoader ImageLoader  with  options.images.format: 'image' ImageBitmapLoader ImageLoader  with  options.images.format: 'imagebitmap' decodeImage parse(arrayBuffer, ImageLoader) isImage isBinaryImage getImageMIMEType getBinaryImageMIMEType getImageSize getBinaryImageSize getImageMetadata getBinaryImageMIMEType  +  getBinaryImageSize Loader Objects Loaders can no longer have a  loadAndParse  method. Remove it, and just make sure you define  parse  on your loaders instead. @loaders.gl/gltf The  GLTFLoader  now always uses the new v2 parser, and the original  GLTFParser  has been removed. Removal Replacement GLBParser GLBLoader GLBBuilder GLBWriter GLTFParser GLTFLoader GLTFBuilder GLTFWriter packBinaryJson N/A unpackBinaryJson N/A Note that automatic packing of binary data (aka \"packed JSON\" support) was only implemented in the v1  GLTFLoader  and has thus also been removed. Experience showed that packing of binary data for  .glb  files is best handled by applications. GLTFLoader option changes The foillowing top-level options are deprecated and will be removed in v2.0 Removed Option Replacement Descriptions gltf.parserVersion N/A No longer needs to be specied, only the new gltf parser is available. fetchLinkedResources gltf.fetchBuffers ,  gltf.fetchImages fetchImages gltf.fetchImages createImages N/A Images are now always created when fetched decompress gltf.decompressMeshes Decompress Draco compressed meshes (if DracoLoader available). DracoLoader N/A Supply  DracoLoader  to  parse , or call  registerLoaders(pDracoLoader]) postProcess gltf.postProcess Perform additional post processing before returning data. uri baseUri Auto-populated when loading from a url-equipped source fetch N/A fetch is automatically available to sub-loaders. @loaders.gl/draco Removal Replacement DracoParser DracoLoader DracoBuilder DracoWriter Loader Objects Loaders no longer have a  loadAndParse  removed. Just define  parse  on your loaders. Upgrading from v1.2 to v1.3 As with v1.1,  GLTFLoader  will no longer return a  GLTFParser  object in v2.0. A new option  options.gltf.parserVersion: 2  is provided to opt in to the new behavior now. Upgrading from v1.0 to v1.1 A couple of functions have been deprecated and will be removed in v2.0. They now emit console warnings. Start replacing your use of these functions now to remove the console warnings and ensure a smooth future upgrade to v2.0. Also, Node support now requires installing  @loaders.gl/polyfills  before use. @loaders.gl/core Removal: Node support for  fetchFile  now requires importing  @loaders.gl/polyfills  before use. Removal: Node support for  TextEncoder , and  TextDecoder  now requires importing  @loaders.gl/polyfills  before use. Deprecation:  TextEncoder  and  TextDecoder  will not be exported from  loaders.gl/core  in v2.0. @loaders.gl/images Removal: Node support for images now requires importing  @loaders.gl/polyfills  before use. @loaders.gl/gltf Deprecation:  GLBParser / GLBBuilder  - These will be merged into GLTF classes.. Deprecation:  GLTFParser / GLTFBuilder  - The new  GLTF  class can hold GLTF data and lets application access/modify it. Deprecation:  GLTFLoader  will no longer return a  GLTFParser  object in v2.0. Instead it will return a pure javascript object containing the parse json and any binary chunks. This object can be accessed through the  GLTF  class. Set  options.GLTFParser  to  false  to opt in to the new behavior now. v1.0 First official release of loaders.gl.","headings":[{"value":"Upgrade Guide","depth":1},{"value":"Upgrading to v3.0","depth":2},{"value":"Upgrading to v2.3","depth":2},{"value":"Upgrading to v2.2","depth":2},{"value":"Upgrading to v2.1","depth":2},{"value":"Upgrading to v2.0","depth":2},{"value":"@loaders.gl/core","depth":3},{"value":"@loaders.gl/images","depth":3},{"value":"Loader Objects","depth":3},{"value":"@loaders.gl/gltf","depth":3},{"value":"@loaders.gl/draco","depth":3},{"value":"Loader Objects","depth":3},{"value":"Upgrading from v1.2 to v1.3","depth":2},{"value":"Upgrading from v1.0 to v1.1","depth":2},{"value":"@loaders.gl/core","depth":3},{"value":"@loaders.gl/images","depth":3},{"value":"@loaders.gl/gltf","depth":3},{"value":"v1.0","depth":2}],"slug":"docs/upgrade-guide","title":"Upgrade Guide"},{"excerpt":"Roadmap For information planned work, see: RFCs  - technical writeups that describe proposed features.

Overview loaders.gl is a is a collection of the best open source loaders and writers for file formats focused on visualization of big data, including point clouds, 3D geometries, images, geospatial formats as well as tabular data. loader.gl is packaged and published as a composable module suite with consistent APIs and features across the suite, and supports advanced features such as running loaders on workers and incremental loading (streaming) in a consistent way across the entire suite, and all loaders work in both the browser and in Node.js. loaders.gl is framework-agnostic, and all loaders and writers are designed to be usable with any JavaScript application or framework with a minimal amount of glue code. Naturally, other  vis.gl frameworks  such as  deck.gl  and  luma.gl  are designed to integrate seamlessly with loaders.gl. Loaders loaders.gl provides a wide selection of loaders organized into categories: Category Loaders Table Loaders Streaming tabular loaders for  CSV ,  JSON ,  Arrow  etc Image Loaders Loaders for  images ,  compressed textures ,  supercompressed textures (Basis) . Utilities for  mipmapped arrays ,  cubemaps ,  binary images  and more. Pointcloud and Mesh Loaders Loaders for point cloud and simple mesh formats such as  Draco ,  LAS ,  PCD ,  PLY ,  OBJ , and  Terrain . Scenegraph Loaders glTF  loader 3D Tile Loaders Loaders for 3D tile formats such as  3D Tiles ,  I3S  and potree Geospatial Loaders Loaders for geospatial formats such as  GeoJSON   KML ,  WKT/WKB ,  Mapbox Vector Tiles  etc. Code Examples loaders.gl provides a small core API module with common functions to load and save data, and a range of optional modules that provide loaders and writers for specific file formats. A minimal example using the  load  function and the  CSVLoader  to load a CSV formatted table into a JavaScript array: Streaming parsing is available using ES2018 async iterators, e.g. allowing \"larger than memory\" files to be incrementally processed: To quickly get up to speed on how the loaders.gl API works, please see  Get Started . Supported Platforms loaders.gl provides consistent support for both browsers and Node.js. The following platforms are supported: Evergreen Browsers  loaders.gl supports recent versions of the major evergreen browsers (e.g. Chrome, Firefox, Safari) on both desktop and mobile. Node.js  LTS (Long-Term Support)  releases  are also supported through the  @loaders.gl/polyfills  module. Edge and IE11  are not actively supported, however loaders.gl 2.3 is known to run on Edge and IE11. Both  @loaders.gl/polyfills  and additional appropriate polyfills (e.g. babel polyfills) need to be installed which will increase your application bundle size. For loaders.gl 3.0, additional transpilation of your  node_modules  folder may also be required. Note that because of lack of regualar testing on these older platforms, regressions can occur. Pinning your loaders.gl version is advisable. Main Design Goals Framework Agnostic  - Files are parsed into clearly documented data structures (objects + typed arrays) that can be used with any JavaScript framework. Worker Support  - Many loaders run in web workers, keeping the main thread free for other tasks while parsing completes. Streaming Support  - Several loaders can parse in batches from both node and browser  Stream s, allowing \"larger than memory\" files to be processed, and initial results to be available while the remainder of a file is still loading. Node Support  - All loaders work under Node.js and can be used when writing backend and cloud services, and when running your unit tests under Node. Loader Categories  - loaders.gl groups similar data formats into \"categories\". loaders in the same category return parsed data in \"standardized\" form, simplifying applications that want to handle multiple related formats. Format Autodection  - Applications can specify multiple loaders when parsing a file, and loaders.gl will automatically pick the right loader for a given file based on file extension, MIME type and file header. Bundle Size Optimized  - Each format is published as an independent npm module to allow applications to cherry-pick only the loaders it needs, modules are optimized for tree-shaking, large loader libraries and workers are loaded from CDN and not bundled. Modern JavaScript  - loaders.gl is written in standard ES2018 and the API emphasizes modern, portable JavaScript constructs, e.g. async iterators instead of streams,  ArrayBuffer  instead of  Buffer , etc. Binary Data Optimized  - loaders.gl is optimized for use with WebGL frameworks (e.g. by returning typed arrays whenever possible). However, there are no any actual WebGL dependencies and loaders can be used without restrictions in non-WebGL applications. Multi-Asset Loading  - Some formats like glTF, or mipmapped cube textures, can required dozens of separate loads to resolve all linked assets (external buffers, images etc). Tracking all the resulting async loads can cause complications for applications. By default, loaders.gl loads all linked assets before resolving a returned  Promise . Licenses loaders.gl contains code under several permissive open source licenses, currently MIT, BSD and Apache licenses. Additional licenses might be included in the future, however loaders.gl will never include code with non-permissive, commercial or copy-left licenses. Note that each loader module comes with its own license, so if the distinction matters to you, please check and decide accordingly. Credits and Attributions loaders.gl is maintained by a group of organizations collaborating through open governance under the Linux Foundation. loaders.gl is partly a repackaging of superb work done by many others in the open source community. We try to be as explicit as we can about the origins and attributions of each loader, both in the documentation page for each loader and in the preservation of comments relating to authorship and contributions inside forked source code. Even so, we can make mistakes, and we may not have the full history of the code we are reusing. If you think that we have missed something, or that we could do better in regard to attribution, please let us know.

The 3D Tiles category defines a generalized representation of hierarchical geospatial data structures. 3D Tiles Category Loaders Loader Notes Tiles3DLoader CesiumIonLoader I3SLoader PotreeLoader Overview The 3D Tiles category is can represent the OGC 3D Tiles  standard OGC i3s  standard potree  format as well. Concepts Tile Header Hierarchy  - An initial, \"minimal\" set of data listing the  hierarchy of available tiles , with minimal information to allow an application to determine which tiles need to be loaded based on a certain viewing position in 3d space. Tile Header  - A minimal header describing a tiles bounding volume and a screen space error tolerance (allowing the tile to be culled if it is distant), as well as the URL to load the tile's actual content from. Tile Cache  - Since the number of tiles in big tilesets often exceed what can be loaded into available memory, it is important to have a system that releases no-longer visible tiles from memory. Tileset Traversal  - Dynamically loading and rendering 3D tiles based on current viewing position, possibly triggering loads of new tiles and unloading of older, no-longer visible tiles. Data Format Check  Tiles3DLoader ,  CesiumIonLoader  | |\nand  I3SLoader . Helper Classes Tileset Traversal Support To start loading tiles once a top-level tileset file is loaded, the application can instantiate the  Tileset3D  class and start calling  tileset3D.update(viewport) . Since 3D tiled data sets tend to be very big, the key idea is to only load the tiles actually needed to show a view from the current camera position. The  Tileset3D  allows callbacks ( onTileLoad ,  onTileUnload ) to be registered that notify the app when the set of tiles available for rendering has changed. This is important because tile loads complete asynchronously, after the  tileset3D.update(...)  call has returned. Additional Information Coordinate Systems To help applications process the  position  data in the tiles, 3D Tiles category loaders are expected to provide matrices are provided to enable tiles to be used in both fixed frame or cartographic (long/lat-relative, east-north-up / ENU) coordinate systems: cartesian  WGS84 fixed frame coordinates cartographic  tile geometry positions to ENU meter offsets from  cartographicOrigin . Position units in both cases are in meters. For cartographic coordinates, tiles come with a prechosen cartographic origin and precalculated model matrix. This cartographic origin is \"arbitrary\" (chosen based on the tiles bounding volume center). A different origin can be chosen and a transform can be calculated, e.g. using the math.gl  Ellipsoid  class.","headings":[{"value":"3D Tiles Loaders","depth":1},{"value":"3D Tiles Category Loaders","depth":2},{"value":"Overview","depth":2},{"value":"Concepts","depth":2},{"value":"Data Format","depth":2},{"value":"Helper Classes","depth":2},{"value":"Additional Information","depth":2},{"value":"Coordinate Systems","depth":3}],"slug":"docs/specifications/category-3d-tiles","title":"3D Tiles Loaders"},{"excerpt":"Geospatial Loaders The Geospatial category is experimental Several geospatial formats return data in the form of lists of lng/lat encoded geometric objects.

Significant performance improvements for library loading and decoding. @loaders.gl/kml New loaders:  GPXLoader  and  TCXLoader  to parse common formats for recorded GPS tracks. v2.3 Release Date: October 12, 2020 This release brings a new Shapefile loader, compression codecs (Zlib, LZ4, Zstandard), support for binary output from geospatial loaders, and a range of improvements supporting loaders.gl integration with kepler.gl, a major geospatial application. @loaders.gl/shapefile  (NEW) A new loader for the ESRI Shapefile format has been added. It loads  .SHP  and (if available)  .DBF ,  .CPG  and  .PRJ  files and returns a geojson like geometry. @loaders.gl/compression  (NEW) A new module with compression/decompression transforms for compression codecs (Zlib, LZ4, Zstandard). As always, these work reliably in both browsers and Node.js. @loaders.gl/crypto  (NEW) A new module for calculating cryptographic hashes (MD5, SHA256 etc). Provided transforms enables hashes to be calculated incrementally, e.g. on incoming binary chunks while streaming data into  parseInBatches . @loaders.gl/draco Draco3D libraries are upgraded to version 1.3.6. Draco metadata can now be encoded and decoded. Custom Draco attributes are now decoded. @loaders.gl/gltf GLBLoader  can now read older GLB v1 files in addition to GLB v2. GLTFLoader  now offers optional, partial support for reading older glTF v1 files and automatically converting them to glTF v2 format (via  options.glt.normalize ). @loaders.gl/json Binary output is now available for the  GeoJsonLoader , via  options.gis.format: 'binary' . @loaders.gl/kml Binary output is now available for the  KMLLoader , via  options.gis.format: 'binary' . @loaders.gl/las Uses a newer version of the  laz-perf  parser (1.4.4). @loaders.gl/mvt Binary output is now available for the Mapbox Vector Tiles  MVTLoader , via  options.gis.format: 'binary' . @loaders.gl/core parseInBatches()  now allows the caller to specify \"transforms\" that shoud be applied on the input data before parsing, via  options.transforms . See the new crypto and compression modules for available transforms to calculate cryptographic hashes on / decompress \"streaming\" data. parseInBatches()  can now be called on all loaders. Non-batched loaders will just return a single batch. options.fetch  ( load ,  parse  etc.) can now be used to supply a either a  fetch  options object or a custom  fetch  function. (BREAKING)  selectLoader()  is now async and returns a  Promise  that resolves to a loader. selectLoader()  can now select loaders through content sniffing of  Blob  and  File  objects. selectLoaderSync()  has been added for situations when calling an async function is not practial. @loaders.gl/polyfills fetch  polyfill: Files with  .gz  extension are automatically decompressed with gzip. The extension reported in the  fetch  response has the  .gz  extension removed. fetch  polyfill: Improved robustness and error handling in Node.js when opening unreadable or non-existent files. Underlying errors ( ENOEXIST ,  EISDIR  etc) are now caught and reported in  Response.statusText . Blob  and  File , new experimental polyfills. v2.2 Framework and loader improvements based on usage in applications. Release Date: June 18, 2020 Typescript Type Definitions Typescript type definitions ( d.ts  files) are now provided for some loaders.gl modules that export APIs (functions and classes). Loader Improvements @loaders.gl/core parseInBatches  a new  options.metadata  option adds an initial batch with metadata about what data format is being loaded. selectLoader  (and  parse  etc) now recognizes unique unregistered MIME types (e.g  application/x.ply ) for every loader. This enable applications that can set  content-type  headers to have precise control over loader selection. @loaders.gl/images The  ImageLoader  now loads images as  Imagebitmap  by default on browsers that support  ImageBitmap  (Chrome and Firefox). The performance improvements are dramatic, which can be verified in the new  benchmark example . @loaders.gl/i3s Addresses a number of compatibility issues with different I3S tilesets that have been reported by users. @loaders.gl/terrain A new  QuantizedMeshLoader  has been added to the  terrain  module to decode the  Quantized Mesh  format. @loaders.gl/video  (new loader module) An experimental new module with video loading and GIF generation support. @loaders.gl/wkt A new  WKBLoader  has been added to the  wkt  module to decode the  Well-Known Binary  format. Worker support for the  WKTLoader , designed to support future binary data improvements. @loaders.gl/json parseInBatches  now accepts  options.json.jsonpaths  to specify which array should be streamed using limited JSONPath syntax (e.g.  '$.features'  for GeoJSON). parseInBatches  returned batches now contain a  batch.bytesUsed  field to enable progress bars. parseInBatches  partial and final result batches are now generated when setting the  metadata: true  options. .geojson  files can now alternatively be parsed by a new experimental  GeoJSONLoader  (exported with an underscore as  _GeoJSONLoader ), introduced to support future binary data improvements. @loaders.gl/csv parseInBatches  now returns a  batch.bytesUsed  field to enable progress bars. Header auto-detection available via  options.csv.header: 'auto' . @loaders.gl/arrow Updated to use  apache-arrow  version  0.17.0 . @loaders.gl/3d-tiles The  Tile3DLoader  now installs the  DracoLoader . The application no longer needs to import and register the  DracoWorkerLoader . @loaders.gl/gltf The  GLTFLoader  now installs the  DracoLoader . The application no longer needs to import and register the  DracoWorkerLoader . @loaders.gl/polyfills The  fetch  and  Response  polyfills for Node.js have been significantly improved, supporting more types of input and parameters with higher fidelity The  fetch  polyfill now automatically add the  accept-encoding  header and automatically decompresses  gzip ,  brotli  and  deflate  compressed responses. v2.1 Release Date: Mar 16, 2020 This release adds a number of new geospatial format loaders New Geospatial Loaders The new loaders empowers rendering frameworks to visualize various geospatial datasets. @loaders.gl/i3s  (new loader module) A new loader module for  I3S  tiles is added to the 3D Tiles family. Checkout the San Francisco Buildings  example . This is a collaboration with ESRI and Tamrat Belayneh  @Tamrat-B @loaders.gl/mvt  (new loader module) A new loader module for loading  Mapbox Vector Tiles . Development was led by contributors from  CARTO , @loaders.gl/terrain  (new loader module) A new loader module for reconstructing mesh surfaces from height map images. Check out the  example  with deck.gl's  TerrainLayer . @loaders.gl/wkt  (new loader module) A new loader module for the Well-Known Text geometry format. Other Improvements @loaders.gl/core The  load  and  parse  functions can now read data directly from  Stream  objects both in node and browser. @loaders.gl/arrow The ArrowJS dependency has been upgraded to v0.16. The ArrowJS API documentation in the loaders.gl website has been improved. @loaders.gl/images Images can now be loaded as data: Using the  ImageLoader  with  options.image.type: 'data'  parameter will return an  image data object  with width, height and a typed array containing the image data (instead of an opaque  Image  or  ImageBitmap  instance). ImageBitmap  loading now works reliably, use  ImageLoader  with  options.image.type: 'imagebitmap' . @loaders.gl/json The streaming JSON loader now has an experimental option  _rootObjectBatches  that returns the top-level JSON object containing the JSON array being streamed, as additional first (partial) and last (complete) batches. Mesh Category Add  boundingBox  to  mesh category  header v2.0 Release Date: Dec 20, 2019 The 2.0 release brings potentially dramatic bundle size savings through dynamic loading of loaders and workers, significant overhauls to several loaders including , image loading improvements and the glTF loader, and a powerful loader composition system. Loader-Specific Options  Each loader now defines its own sub object in the options object. This makes it possible to cleanly specify options for multiple loaders at the same time. This is helpful when loaders.gl auto-selects a pre-registered loader or when passing options to a sub-loader when using a composite loader. Smaller Loaders  Big loaders such as  DracoLoader  and  BasisLoader  that use large libraries (e.g. WASM/WebAssembly or emscripten/C++ transpiled to JavaScript) now load those libraries dynamically from  unpkg.com  CDN resulting in dramatic bundle size savings. E.g the bundle size impact of the  DracoLoader  was reduced from > 1MB to just over 10KB. Worker Loaders Ease-of-use: Worker loading is provided by the main loader objects. It is not necessary to import the  ...WorkerLoader  objects to enable worker loading (but see below about bundle size) Performance: Loading on worker threads is now the default: All worker enabled loaders now run on worker threads by default (set  options.worker: false  to disable worker-thread loading and run the loader on the main thread). Debugging: Development builds of workers are now available on  unpkg.com  CDN, eabling debugging of worker loaders. Bundle size: Workers are no longer bundled, but loaded from from the  unpkg.com  CDN. Bundle size: Note that the old  ...WorkerLoader  classes are still available. Using these can save even more bundle space since during tree-shaking since they do not depend on the non-worker parser. Composite Loaders The new  composite loader  architecture enables complex loaders like  Tiles3DLoader  and  GLTFLoader  to be composed from more primitive loaders without losing the ability to run some parts on worker, pass arguments to sub-loaders etc. New Loader Modules @loaders.gl/basis  (Experimental) A new module for the basis format that enables. This module also provides a  CompressedImageLoader  for more traditional compressed images. @loaders.gl/json  (Experimental) A new streaming  JSONLoader  that supports batched (i.e. streaming) parsing from standard JSON files, e.g. geojson. No need to reformat your files as line delimited JSON. Update Loader Modules @loaders.gl/gltf  the  GLTFLoader  is now a \"composite loader\". The perhaps most important change is that  load(url, GLTFLoader)  also loads all sub-assets, including images, Draco compressed meshes, etc making the loaded data easier for applications to use. @loaders.gl/images  see below for a list of changes @loaders.gl/images Updates New ImageLoader options   options: {image: {}}  contain common options that apply across the category options.image.type , Ability to control loaded image type enabling faster  ImageBitmap  instances to be loaded via  type: 'imagebitmap . Default  auto  setting returns traditional HTML image objects. Image Decoding.  options.image.decodeHTML: true  -  ImageLoader  now ensures HTML images are completely decoded and ready to be used when the image is returned (by calling  Image.decode() ). Parsed Image API  Since the type of images returned by the  ImageLoader  depends on the  {image: {type: ...}}  option, a set of functions are provided to work portably with loaded images:  isImage() ,  getImageType() ,  getImageData() , ... Binary Image API  Separate API to work with unparsed images in binary data form:  isBinaryImage() ,  getBinaryImageType() ,  getBinaryImageSize() , ... \"Texture\" Loading API  New methods  loadImages  and  loadImageCube  can signficantly simplify loading of arrays of arrays of (mipmapped) images that are often used in 3D applications. These methods allow an entire complex of images (e.g. 6 cube faces with 10 mip images each) to be loaded using a single async call. Improved Node.js support  More image test cases are now run in both browser and Node.js and a couple of important Node.js issues were uncovered and fixed. v1.3 Release Date: Sep 13, 2019 The 1.3 release is focused on production quality 3D tiles support, maturing the v2 glTF parser, and provides some improvements to the core API. @loaders.gl/3d-tiles Tile3DLayer moved to deck.gl The  Tile3DLayer  can now be imported from  @deck.gl/geo-layers , and no longer needs to be copied from the loaders.gl  3d-tiles  example Batched 3D Model Tile Support b3dm  tiles can now be loaded and displayed by the  Tile3DLayer  (in addition to  pnts  tiles). Performance Tracking Tileset3D  now contain a  stats  object which tracks the loading process to help profile big tilesets. Easily displayed in your UI via the  @probe.gl/stats-widget  module (see 3d-tiles example). Request Scheduling The  Tileset3D  class now cancels loads for not-yet loaded tiles that are no longer in view). Scheduling dramatically improves loading performance when panning/zooming through large tilesets. @loaders.gl/gltf Version 2 Improvements Select the new glTF parser by passing  options.gltf.parserVersion: 2  to the  GLTFLoader . Many improvements to the v2 glTF parser. @loaders.gl/core Loader Selection Improvements The loader selection mechanism is now exposed to apps through the new  selectLoader  API. Loaders can now examine the first bytes of a file This complements the existing URL extension based auto detection mechanisms. Worker Thread Pool Now reuses worker threads. Performance gains by avoiding worker startup overhead. Worker threads are named, easy to track in debugger Worker based loaders can now call  parse  recursively to delegate parsing of embedded data (e.g. glTF, Draco) to other loaders v1.2 The 1.2 release is a smaller release that resolves various issues encountered while using 1.1. Release Date: Aug 8, 2019 @loaders.gl/core : File Type Auto Detection now supports binary files @loaders.gl/polyfills : Fixed  TextEncoder  warnings @loaders.gl/arrow : Improved Node 8 support @loaders.gl/images : Image file extensions now added to loader object @loaders.gl/gltf : Generate default sampler parameters if none provided in gltf file @loaders.gl/3d-tiles (EXPERIMENTAL) Support for dynamic traversal of 3D tilesets (automatically loads and unloads tiles based on viewer position and view frustum). Support for loading tilesets from Cesium ION servers. Asynchronous tileset loading Auto centering of view based on tileset bounding volumes deck.gl  Tile3DLayer  class provided in examples. v1.1 The 1.1 release addresses a number of gaps in original loaders.gl release, introduces the  GLTFLoader , and initiates work on 3DTiles support. Release Date: May 30, 2019 @loaders.gl/core fetchFile  function - Can now read browser  File  objects (from drag and drop or file selection dialogs). isImage(arrayBuffer [, mimeType])  function - can now accept a MIME type as second argument. @loaders.gl/images getImageMIMEType(arrayBuffer)  function ( EW) - returns the MIME type of the image in the supplied  ArrayBuffer . isImage(arrayBuffer [, mimeType])  function - can now accept a MIME type as second argument. @loaders.gl/gltf The glTF module has been refactored with the aim of simplifying the loaded data and orthogonalizing the API. \"Embedded' GLB data (GLBs inside other binary formats) can now be parsed (e.g. the glTF parser can now extract embedded glTF inside 3D tile files). New classes/functions: GLTFScenegraph  class (NEW) - A helper class that provides methods for structured access to and modification/creation of glTF data. postProcessGLTF  function ( EW) - Function that performs a set of transformations on loaded glTF data that simplify application processing. GLBLoader / GLBWriter  - loader/writer pair that enables loading/saving custom (non-glTF) data in the binary GLB format. GLTFLoader , letting application separately handle post-processing. @loaders.gl/3d-tiles (NEW MODULE) Support for the 3D tiles format is being developed in the new  @loaders.gl/3d-tiles  module. Loading of individual point cloud tiles, including support for Draco compression and compact color formats such as RGB565 is supported. @loaders.gl/polyfills (NEW MODULE) Node support now requires importing  @loaders.gl/polyfills  before use. This reduces the number of dependencies, bundle size and potential build complications when using other loaders.gl modules when not using Node.js support. @loaders.gl/loader-utils (NEW MODULE) Helper functions for loaders have been broken out from  @loaders.gl/core .

Chunked Columnar Tables (DataFrames) A problem with columnar tables is that column arrays they can get very long, causing issues with streaming, memory allication etc. A powerful solution is to worked with chunked columnar tables, where columns is are broken into matching sequences of typed arrays. The down-side is that complexity can increase quickly.

Mesh/PointCloud Category Loaders Loader Notes DracoLoader LASLoader OBJLoader PCDLoader PLYLoader QuantizedMeshLoader TerrainLoader Data Format A single mesh is typically defined by a set of attributes, such as  positions ,  colors ,  normals  etc, as well as a draw mode. The Pointcloud/Mesh loaders output mesh data in a common form that is optimized for use in WebGL frameworks: All attributes (and indices if present) are stored as typed arrays of the proper type. All attributes (and indices if present) are wrapped into glTF-style \"accessor objects\", e.g.  {size: 1-4, value: typedArray} . Attribute names are mapped to glTF attribute names (on a best-effort basis). An  indices  field is added (only if present in the loaded geometry). A primitive drawing  mode  value is added (the numeric value matches WebGL constants, e.g  GL.TRIANGLES ).

When a loader can map an attribute name, it will replace ir with the glTF equivalent. This allows applications to use common code to handle meshes and point clouds from different formats.

Any such alignment needs to be done by the application as a second step. Limitations Scenegraph support For more complex, scenegraph-type formats (i.e. formats that contain multiple geometric primitives), loaders.gl provides glTF 2.0 support via the  GLTFLoader .

Image Category Loaders Loader Notes ImageLoader Loads compressed images (PNG, JPG, etc) CompressedTextureLoader Parses compressed textures to image data mipmap array BasisLoader Transpiles into supported compressed texture format Core image category support is provided by the  @loaders.gl/images  module: Usage Individual loaders for specific image formats can be imported for  @loaders.gl/images : However since each image loader is quite small (in terms of code size and bundle size impact), most applications will just install all image loaders in one go: Image Types Images can be loaded as image data or as opaque image objects ( Image  or  ImageBitmap ), and the image  type  option can be used to control the type of image object produced by the  ImageLoader . A loaded image can always be returned as an  image data  object (an object containing a  Uint8Array  with the pixel data, and metadata like  width  and  height , and in Node.js images are always loaded as image data objects). In the browser, the  ImageLoader  uses the browser's native image loading functionality, and if direct access to the image data is not required, it is more efficient to load data into an opaque image object. The  ImageLoader  prefers  ImageBitmap  when supported, falling back to  Image  (aka  HTMLImageElement ) on older browsers. Note that  type  is independent of the  format  of the image (see below). Image Type Class Availability Workers Description data Object with  {width: Number, height: Number, data: Uint8Array, ...} Node.js and browsers No Compatible with headless gl. imagebitmap ImageBitmap Chrome/Firefox Yes:  transferrable A newer JavaScript class designed for efficient loading of images, optimized for use in worker threads and with WebGL image Image  (aka  HTMLImageElement ) All browsers No The traditional HTML/JavaScript class used for image loading into DOM trees. WebGL compatible. Image Data Image data objects are images loaded as data, represented by an object that contains a typed array with the pixel data, size, and possibly additional metadata  {width: Number, height: Number, data: Uint8Array, ...} To get an image data object from a loaded  Image  or  ImageBitmap , call  getImageData(image) . To load an image data object directly, set the  image.type: 'data'  option when loading the image. Image Formats The  format  of the image describes how the memory is laid out. It is mainly important when working with  data   type  images. The default format / memory layout for image data is  RGBA  and  UNSIGNED_BYTE  i.e. four components per pixel, each a byte. Some loaders may add additional fields to the image data structure to describe the data format. Currently the image category does not provide any documentation for how to describe alternate formats/memory layouts, however a preliminary recommendation is to follow OpenGL/WebGL conventions. Compressed Images Compressed images are always returned as image data objects. They will have an additional field,  compressed: true , indicating that the typed array in the  data  field contains compressed pixels and is not directly indexable. Applications that use e.g. the  CompressedTextureLoader  and/or the  BasisLoader  together with the  ImageLoader  can check this flag before attempting to access the image data. Options The image category support some generic options (specified using  options.image.<option-name> ), that are applicable to all (or most) image loaders. Option Default Type Availability Description options.image.type 'auto' string See table One of  auto ,  data ,  imagebitmap ,  image options.image.decode true boolean No: Edge, IE11 Wait for HTMLImages to be fully decoded. Notes About worker loading Worker loading is only supported for the  data  and  imagebitmap  formats. Since image worker loading is only available on some browsers (Chrome and Firefox), the  ImageLoader  dynamically determines if worker loading is available. Use  options.worker: false  to disable worker loading of images.

Loaders Loader Notes GLTFLoader GLBLoader Data Format The data format is fairly raw, close to the unpacked glTF/GLB data structure, it is described by: a parsed JSON object (with top level arrays for  scenes ,  nodes  etc) a list of  ArrayBuffer s representing binary blocks (into which  bufferViews  and  images  in the JSON point).

Therefore, the current recommendation is to first convert scenegraph files in other formats to glTF with external tools before loading them using loaders.gl. That said, hypothetical new loaders for other scenegraph formats (e.g. a COLLADA loader) could potentially choose to belong to the Scenegraph category by \"converting\" loaded data to the format described on this page.

Depending on how the underlying loader works (whether it is synchronous or asynchronous and whether it expects text or binary data), the loader object can expose the parser in a couple of different ways, specified by provided one of the parser function fields. Dependency Management In general, it is recommended that loaders are \"standalone\" and avoid importing  @loaders.gl/core .  @loaders.gl/loader-utils  provides a small set of shared loader utilities. Creating Composite Loaders loaders.gl enables loaders to call other loaders (referred to as \"sub-loaders\" in this section). This enables loaders for \"composite formats\" to be \"composed\" out of loaders for the primitive parts. Good examples of sub-loaders are the  GLTFLoader  which can delegate Draco mesh decoding to the  DracoLoader  and image decoding to the various  ImageLoaders  and the  BasisLoader . Naturally, Composite loaders can call other composite loaders, which is for instance used by the  Tiles3DLoader  which uses the  GLTFLoader  to parse embedded glTF data in certain tiles. Calling loaders inside loaders To call another loader, a loader should use the appropriate  parse  function provided in the  context  parameter. A conceptual example of a 3D Tiles loader calling the  GLTFLoader  with some additional options. Remarks: While a loader could potentially import  parse  from  @loaders.gl/core  to invoke a sub-loader, it is discouraged, not only from a dependency management reasons, but it prevents loaders.gl from properly handling parameters and allow worker-loaders to call other loaders.","headings":[{"value":"Creating New Loaders and Writers","depth":1},{"value":"Overview","depth":2},{"value":"Creating a Loader Object","depth":2},{"value":"Dependency Management","depth":2},{"value":"Creating Composite Loaders","depth":2},{"value":"Calling loaders inside loaders","depth":2}],"slug":"docs/developer-guide/creating-loaders-and-writers","title":"Creating New Loaders and Writers"},{"excerpt":"Writer Object To be compatible with  @loaders.gl/core  functions such as  encode , writer objects need to conform to the following specification: Common Fields Field Type Default Description name String Required Short name of the loader ('OBJ', 'PLY' etc) extension String Required Three letter (typically) extension used by files of this format category String Optional Indicates the type/shape of data Encoder Function Field Type Default Description encodeSync Function null Encodes synchronously encode Function null Encodes asynchronously encodeInBatches  (Experimental) Function null Encodes and releases batches through an async iterator Note: The format of the input data to the encoders depends on the loader.

The idea is that many loaders return very similar data (e.g. point clouds loaders), which makes it possible to represent the loaded data in the same data structure, letting applications handle the output from multiple loaders without When a loader is documented as belonging to a specifc category, it converts the parsed data into the common format for that category. This allows an application to support multiple formats with a single code path, since all the loaders will return similar data structures. Categories and Loader Registration The fact that loaders belong to categories enable applications to flexibly register new loaders in the same category. For instance, once an application has added support for one loader in a category, other loaders in the same category can be registered during application startup. Original code Now support for additional point cloud formats can be added to the application without touching the original code: Data Format Each category documents the returned data format. loaders and writers reference the category documentation. Writers and Categories Writers for a format that belongs to a category accept data objects with fields described by the documentation for that category. Accessing Format-Specific Data Sometimes, not all the properties provided by a certain file format can be mapped to common properties defined by the corresponding loader category.

Ideally the applications wants to use a simple clean API for the loading, and yet have the confidence that errors are caught and meaningful messages are presented to the user. Types of Errors There are three main types of errors that arise when attempting to load a data resource: There is some kind of network/resource access error, preventing the request for data from being issued A request is sent to a server, but the server is unable to service the request due to some error condition (often illegal access tokens or request parameters) and sends an error response. The server returns data, but the parser is unable to parse it (perhaps due to the data being malformatted, or formatted according to an unsupported version of that format). loaders.gl can detect all of these error conditions and report the resulting errors in a unified way (the errors will be available as exceptions or rejected promises depending on your async programming style, see below). Error Messages loaders.gl aims to produce concise, easy-to-understand error messages that can be presented directly to the end user. When the fetch call fails, the genereted exception is passed to the user, and the same is true when a loader fails. For server error responses, some basic information about the error is compiled into an error message (using e.g.  response.status ,  response.url  and occasionally  response.text ). Note that while servers often send some information about errors in  response.text()  when setting HTTP error codes, there are no universally adhered-to conventions for how servers format those error messages. The data is often a set of key-value pairs that are JSON or XML encoded, but even then the exact key names are usually server-specific. At the moment loaders.gl does not provide any error formatting plugins, so if you know how your specific service formats errors and want to extract these in a way that you can present to the user, you may want to take control of the fetch  Response  status checking, see below. parse Error Handling parse  accepts fetch  Response  objects, and  parse  will check the status of the  Response  before attempting to parse, and generate an exception if appropriate. Handling Errors from Async Functions Note that  parse  is an async function, and in JavaScript, errors generated by async functions will be reported either as an exception or as a rejected promise, depending on how the async funtion was called (using promises or the  await  keyword): When using  await , errors are reported as exceptions A rejected promise is generated when using  Promise.then . Also note that the Javascript runtime seamlessly converts errors between exceptions and promises in mixed code. fetch Error Handling loaders.gl is designed around the use of the modern JavaScript  fetch  API, so for additional context, it may help to review of how the JavaSctipt  fetch  function handles errors. fetch  separates between \"network errors\" that can be detected directly (these cause the  fetch  to throw an exception) and server side errors that are reported asynchronously with HTTP status codes (in this case the  Response  object offers accessors that must be called to check if the operation was successful before accessing data). Example: \"manually\" checking separately for fetch network errors and server errors: Note that servers often sends a message providing some detail about what went wrong, and that message can be accessed using the standard (asynchronous)  response.text()  or  response.json()  methods.","headings":[{"value":"Error Handling","depth":1},{"value":"Types of Errors","depth":2},{"value":"Error Messages","depth":3},{"value":"parse Error Handling","depth":2},{"value":"Handling Errors from Async Functions","depth":2},{"value":"fetch Error Handling","depth":2}],"slug":"docs/developer-guide/error-handling","title":"Error Handling"},{"excerpt":"Using Loaders loaders.gl has parser functions that use so called \"loaders\" to convert the raw data loaded from files into parsed objects. Each loader encapsulates a parsing function for one file format (or a group of related file formats) together with some metadata (like the loader name, common file extensions for the format etc). Installing loaders loaders.gl provides a suite of pre-built loader objects packaged as scoped npm modules. The intention is that applications will install and import loaders only for the formats they need. Using Loaders Loaders are passed into utility functions in the loaders.gl core API to enable parsing of the chosen format. Specifying and Registering Loaders As seen above can be specified directly in a call to  load  or any of the  parse  functions: Loaders can also be registered globally. To register a loader, use  registerLoaders : Selecting Loaders The loader selection algorithm is exposed to applications via  selectLoader : Note: Selection works on urls and/or data Loader Options load ,  parse  and other core functions accept loader options in the form of an options object. Such loader options objects are organized into nested sub objects, with one sub-object per loader or loader category. This provides a structured way to pass options to multiple loaders. An advantage of this design is that since the core functions can select a loader from a list of multiple candidate loaders, or invoke sub-loaders, the nested options system allows separate specification of options to each loader in a single options object. Loader options are merged with default options using a deep, two-level merge. Any object-valued key on the top level will be merged with the corresponding key value in the default options object. Using Composite Loaders loaders.gl enables the creation of  composite loaders  that call other loaders (referred to as \"sub-loaders\" in this section). This enables loaders for \"composite formats\" to be quickly composed out of loaders for the primitive parts. Composite Loader usage is designed to be conceptually simple for applications (loaders.gl handles a number of subtleties under the hood). A composite loader is called just like any other loader, however there are some additional Parameter Passing between Loaders Loaders and parameters are passed through to sub loaders and are merged so that applications can override them: In this example: the passed in loaders would override any loaders specified inside the sub-loaders as well as any globally registered loaders. The options will be passed through to the sub-loaders, so that the  GLTFLoader  will receive the  gltf  options, merged with any  gltf  options set by the  Tiles3DLoader . This override system makes it easy for applications to test alternate sub-loaders or parameter options without having to modify any existing loader code.","headings":[{"value":"Using Loaders","depth":1},{"value":"Installing loaders","depth":2},{"value":"Using Loaders","depth":2},{"value":"Specifying and Registering Loaders","depth":2},{"value":"Selecting Loaders","depth":2},{"value":"Loader Options","depth":2},{"value":"Using Composite Loaders","depth":2},{"value":"Parameter Passing between Loaders","depth":3}],"slug":"docs/developer-guide/using-loaders","title":"Using Loaders"},{"excerpt":"Polyfills Older browsers (mainly Edge and IE11) as well as Node.js do not provide certain APIs ( TextEncoder ,  fetch  etc) that loaders.gl depends on. The good news is that these APIs can be provided by the application using the  polyfill  technique.

Provided Polyfills See  API Reference . Remarks Applications should typically only install this module if they need to run under older environments. While the polyfills are only installed at runtime if the platform does not already support them, they will still be included in your application bundle, i.e. importing the polyfill module will increase your application's bundle size.

The advantages and characteristics of streaming are descriped in more detail in the  streaming  concepts section, but the highlights are: Ability to parse large data sources that exceed browser memory limits (maximum allocation limits for a single  string  or  ArrayBuffer  etc tends to be less tha 1GB in most browsers). While parsing is done on smaller chunks and does not freeze the main thread. data can be processed (and displayed) as it arrives over the network, rather than at the end of a long request, leading to a more interactive experience. transforms can be applied incrementally to the incoming data, e.g. to cryptographically hash or decrypt data Batches: Async Iterator based Streaming The loaders.gl streaming architecture is built around ES2018 async iterators rather than the more traditional  Stream s. Async iterators are arguably easier to work with than streams, are consistent across browsers and Node.js, and enable a \"callback-less\" programming style supported by built-in JavaScript language features, such as  for await (... of ...)  and  async function * . Note:  Stream  input sources is still accepted by loaders.gl functions, however internally processing is done via async iterators and the output of a batched parsing operation is an async iterator that yields \"batches\" of parsed data. The JSONLoader supports streaming JSON parsing, in which case it will yield \"batches\" of rows from the first array it encounters in the JSON. To e.g. parse a stream of GeoJSON: Streaming Data Sources While the primary input for  parseInBatches  is an async iterator many input types are supported: AsyncIterable<ArrayBuffer>  (i.e. the iterator must yield  ArrayBuffer  chunks). Stream  instances can be used as input to  parseInBatches . An async iterator will automatically be created from the stream. Response  objects can also be used as input (the  Response.body  stream will be used). In addition, note that applications can easily wrap many data types in a  Response  object (e.g.  FormData ,  Blob ,  File ,  string ,  ArrayBuffer  etc), which makes it possible to do streaming loads from almost any data source. Applying Transforms Example of using a transform to calculate a cryptographic hash: Note that by using a transform, the hash is calculated incrementally as batches are loaded and parsed, and does not require having the entire data source loaded into memory. It also distributes the potentially heavy hash calculation over the batches, keeping the main thread responsive.","headings":[{"value":"Using Batched Loaders","depth":1},{"value":"Batches: Async Iterator based Streaming","depth":2},{"value":"Streaming Data Sources","depth":2},{"value":"Applying Transforms","depth":2}],"slug":"docs/developer-guide/using-streaming-loaders","title":"Using Batched Loaders"},{"excerpt":"Using Workers Most loaders.gl loaders can perform parsing on JavaScript worker threads.\nThis means that the main thread will not block during parsing and can continue\nto respond to user interactions or do parallel processing. Worker threads can also run in parallel, increasing your application's performance\nwhen loading parsing many files in parallel. Note that worker thread loading is not always the best choice since the transfer of\ndata between workers and the main thread is only efficient if the data is predominantly\nbinary. When worker thread loading is not offered in a specific loader it is usually\nbecause it would not provide any performance benefits. Another advantage when using pure worker loaders is that the code required to\nparse a format is not bundled into the application but loaded on demand. This is\nparticularly useful when adding loaders that are only used occasionally by your\napplication. More details on advantages and complications with worker thread based loading the  Worker Threads  article in the concepts secion. Processing Data on Workers The  processOnWorker  function in  @loaders.gl/worker-utils  is used with worker objects\nexported by modules like  @loaders.gl/compression  and  @loaders.gl/crypto  to move\nprocessing intensive tasks to workers. Parsing data on Workers Loading Files in Parallel using Worker Loaders The  DracoLoader  is an example of a worker enabled loader. It parses data on worker threads by default. To load two Draco encoded meshes  in parallel  on worker threads, just use the  DracoLoader  as follows: Disabling Worker Loaders Applications can use the  worker: false  option to disable worker loaders, for instance to simplify debugging of parsing issues: Disabling Reuse of Workers Applications reuse already created workers by default. To avoid  enlarge memory arrays  error it is really nesessary to disable it if you need to load multiple datasets in a sequence.\nThis functionality can be disabled by  reuseWorkers: false  option: Concurrency Level and Worker Reuse Concurrency - The  options.maxConcurrency  and  option.maxMobileConcurrency  options can be adjusted to define how many worker instances should be created for each format. Note that setting this higher than roughly the number CPU cores on your current machine will not provide much benefit and may create extra overhead. Worker reuse - Workers threads can occupy memoery and ArrayBuffer Neutering Be aware that when calling worker loaders, binary data is transferred from the calling thread to the worker thread. This means that if you are using  parse , any  ArrayBuffer  parameter you pass in to the will be \"neutered\" and no longer be accessible in the calling thread. Most applications will not need to do further processing on the raw binary data after it has been parsed so this is rarely an issue, but if you do, you may need to copy the data before parsing, or disable worker loading (see above). Specifying Worker Script URLs (Advanced) In JavaScript, worker threads are loaded from separate scripts files and are typically not part of the main application bundle. For ease-of-use, loaders.gl provides a default set of pre-built worker threads which are published on loaders.gl npm distribution from  unpck.com  CDN (Content Delivery Network). As an advanced option, it is possible to for application to specify alternate URLs for loading a pre-built worker loader instance. This can be useful e.g. when building applications that cannot access CDNs or when creating highly customized application builds, or doing in-depth debugging. Composite Loaders and Workers (Advanced) loaders.gl supports sub-loader invocation from worker loaders. This is somewhat experimental A worker loader starts a seperate thread with a javascript bundle that only contains the code for that loader, so a worker loader needs to call the main thread (and indirectly, potentially another worker thread with another worrker loader) to parse using a sub-loader, properly transferring data into and back from the other thread. Debugging Worker Loaders (Advanced) Debugging worker loaders is tricky. While it is always possible to specify  options.worker: false  which helps in many situations, there are cases where the worker loader itself must be debugged. TBA - There is an ambition to provide better support for debugging worker loaders: Pre-build non-minified versions of workers, and provide option to easily select those.

(Refer the documentation of each loader to see if it supports worker thread loading). Loading and parsing of data on worker threads can bring significant advantages Avoid blocking the browser main thread  - when parsing longer files, the main thread can become blocked, effectively \"freezing\" the application's user interface until parsing completes. Parallel parsing on multi-core CPUs  - when parsing multiple files on machines that have multiple cores (essentially all machines, even modern mobile phones tend to have at least two cores), worker threads enables multiple files to be parsed in parallel which can dramatically reduce the total load times. Hoever, there are a number of considerations when loading and parsing data on JavaScript worker threads: Serialization/deserializion overhead  when transferring resuls back to main thread can more than defeat gains from loading on a separate thread. Choice of Data Types  - Due to data transfer issues there are constraints on what data types are appropriate Build configuration  - Workers can require complex build system setup/configuration. Message Passing  - Parsing on workers requires message passing between threads. While simple it can add clutter to application code. Debugging  - Worker based code tends to be harder to debug. Being able to easily switch back to main thread parsing (or an alternate worker build) can be very helpful. Startup Times  - Worker startup times can defeat speed gains from parsing on workers. Data Transfer Threads cannot share non-binary data structures and these have to be serialized/deserialized. This is a big issue for worker thread based loading as the purpose of loaders is typically to load and parse big datastructures, and main thread deserialization times are often comparable to or even exceed the time required to parse the data in the first place, defeating the value of moving parsing to a worker thread. The solution is usually to use data types that support ownership transfer (see next section) as much as possible and minimize the amount of non-binary data returned from the parser. Data Types JavaScript ArrayBuffers and Typed Arrays can be passed with minimal overhead (ownership transfer) and the value of worker based parsing usually depends on whether the loaded data can (mostly) be stored in these types. Message Passing loaders.gl will handle message passing behind the scenes. Loading on a worker thread returns a promise that completes when the worker is done and the data has been transferred back to the main thread. Build Configuration All worker enabled loaders come with a pre-built, minimal worker \"executable\" to enable zero-configuration use in applications. Bundle size concerns All worker enabled loaders provide separate loader objects to ensure that tree-shaking bundlers will be able to remove the code for the unused case. Debugging and Benchmarking Loaders.gl offers loader objects for main thread and worker threads. A simple switch lets you move your loading back to the main thread for easier debugging and benchmarking (comparing speeds to ensure you are gaining the benefits you expect from worker thread based loading).","headings":[{"value":"Worker Threads","depth":1},{"value":"Data Transfer","depth":2},{"value":"Data Types","depth":2},{"value":"Message Passing","depth":2},{"value":"Build Configuration","depth":2},{"value":"Bundle size concerns","depth":2},{"value":"Debugging and Benchmarking","depth":2}],"slug":"docs/developer-guide/concepts/worker-threads","title":"Worker Threads"},{"excerpt":"Binary Data The loaders.gl API consistently uses  ArrayBuffer s to represent and transport binary data. Why ArrayBuffers? One of the design goals of loaders.gl is to provide applications with a single, consistent API that works across (reasonably modern) browsers, worker threads and Node.js. One of the characteristics of this API is how binary data is represented. loaders.gl \"standardizes\" on ArrayBuffers for a number of reasons: ArrayBuffers are the \"canonical\" input format for the WebGL API, allowing efficient uploads of large binary data sets to the GPU. ArrayBuffers allow ownership to be transferred between threads (Browser Main Thread and WebWorkers), massively improving performance when sending data back from loaders running on web worker to the application/main thread. ArrayBuffers are used to transport raw data in most newer JavaScript APIs, including WebSockets, Web Intents, XMLHttpRequest version 2 etc. ArrayBuffers are well supported by recent Node.js versions, in fact the traditional Node.js  Buffer  class is now backed by an  ArrayBuffer . ArrayBuffers and Typed Arrays Recall that typed arrays (e.g.  Float32Array ) are just views into array buffers. Every typed array has a  buffer  reference. Many loaders.gl functions directly accept typed arrays, which essentially means they accept the associated ArrayBuffer. However, be aware that typed arrays can represent partial views (i.e. they can have offsets) that sometimes need special handling in the application. Converting between ArrayBuffers and Strings We use the  TextEncoder  and  TextDecoder  classes in the JavaScript  string encoding/decoding library . Since these classes are central to using ArrayBuffers correctly, loaders.gl provides polyfills for them under Node.js. Binary Types in JavaScript Binary data types in JS: ArrayBuffer Uint8Array  and other typed arrays, plus DataView Blob Buffer  nodejs Examples of \"semi-binary\" data types in JS: Array : Array of bytes (elements are numbers between 0 and 255). String  (binary): string in “binary” form, 1 byte per char (2 bytes). String  (base64): string containing the binary data encoded in a base64 form. Converting between ArrayBuffers and other Binary Formats. Standardizing on ArrayBuffers helps streamline the loaders.gl API. But occasionally applications need to interface with APIs that accept other binary data types/formats. To support this case, loaders.gl provides a small set of utilities (non-exhaustive) for converting from and to other binary JavaScript types/formats, e.g.  toArrayBuffer :","headings":[{"value":"Binary Data","depth":1},{"value":"Why ArrayBuffers?","depth":2},{"value":"ArrayBuffers and Typed Arrays","depth":2},{"value":"Converting between ArrayBuffers and Strings","depth":2},{"value":"Binary Types in JavaScript","depth":2},{"value":"Converting between ArrayBuffers and other Binary Formats.","depth":2}],"slug":"docs/developer-guide/concepts/binary-data","title":"Binary Data"},{"excerpt":"AsyncIterators Streaming functionality in loaders.gl is built on the ES2018  AsyncIterator  concept.

The ambition is that many loaders would support streaming from both Node and DOM streams, through a consistent API and set of conventions (for both applications and loader/writer objects). Streaming Loads Incremental Parsing Some loaders offer incremental parsing (chunks of incomplete data can be parsed, and updates will be sent after a certain batch size has been exceeded). In many cases, parsing is fast compared to loading of data, so incremental parsing on its own may not provide a lot of value for applications. Incremental Loading Incremental parsing becomes more interesting when it can be powered by incremental loading, whether through request updates or streams (see below). Streamed Loading Streamed loading means that the entire data does not need to be loaded. This is particularly advantageous when: loading files with sizes that exceed browser limits (e.g. 1GB in Chrome) doing local processing to files (tranforming one row at a time), this allows pipe constructions that can process files that far exceed internal memory.

With a sampleInterval of 1, the entire image is used in the learning phase, while with an interval of 10, a pseudo-random subset of 1/10 of the pixels are used in the learning phase. A sampling factor of 10 gives a substantial speed-up, with a small quality penalty. Experimental Options These options are forwarded directly to the underlying  gifshot  module.

The  Tileset3D  allows callbacks ( onTileLoad ,  onTileUnload ) to be registered that notify the app when the set of tiles available for rendering has changed. This is important because tile loads complete asynchronously, after the  tileset3D.update(...)  call has returned.

See the  properties schema reference  in the 3D Tiles spec for the full set of properties. maximumScreenSpaceError : Number The maximum screen space error used to drive level of detail refinement. This value helps determine when a tile refines to its descendants, and therefore plays a major role in balancing performance with visual quality. A tile's screen space error is roughly equivalent to the number of pixels wide that would be drawn if a sphere with a\nradius equal to the tile's  geometric error  were rendered at the tile's position. If this value exceeds\n maximumScreenSpaceError  the tile refines to its descendants. Depending on the tileset,  maximumScreenSpaceError  may need to be tweaked to achieve the right balance. Higher values provide better performance but lower visual quality.  * maximumMemoryUsage : Number ^default 16  * \n^exception  maximumScreenSpaceError  must be greater than or equal to zero. The maximum amount of GPU memory (in MB) that may be used to cache tiles. This value is estimated from\ngeometry, textures, and batch table textures of loaded tiles. For point clouds, this value also\nincludes per-point metadata. Tiles not in view are unloaded to enforce this. If decreasing this value results in unloading tiles, the tiles are unloaded the next frame.

More specifically it contains loaders and writers for compressed texture  container  formats, including KTX, DDS and PVR. It also supports supercompressed Basis textures. Note that a texture is more complex than an image. A texture typically has many subimages. A texture can represent a single logical image but can also be a texture cube, a texture array etc representing many logical images. In addition, each \"image\" typically has many mipmap levels. In addition, in compressed textures each mipmap image is compressed opaquely into a format that can only be understood by certain GPUs. Basis encoded textures are super compressed. A more recent addition, they can be efficiently transcoded on the client into actual compressed texture formats appropriate for each device and are therefore quite convenient to use. Installation API Loader Description BasisLoader Compressed Texture API A set of functions that can extract information from \"unparsed\" binary memory representation of certain compressed texture image formats.

However, a compressed texture typically consists of a collection of compressed subimages, representing mipmaps etc. These compressed subimages are stored as an array of \"binary blobs\" in a container file. Only the container file is parsed, extracting metadata and the binary buffers representing subimages. The binary subimages can then be passed directly to a GPU that understands how to read pixels directly from them without decompressing them first. Supercompressed textures  are an intermediate format whose subimages are compressed in a common format. This format can be cheaply transcoded on to a real compressed texture format supported on the current client, without decompressing and recompressing the texture. This allows a single supercompressed texture to be portably used on multiple platforms even though those platforms do not support the same compressed texture formats. Performance Considerations Advantages: Compressed textures can allow a lot more textures (~4x) to be stored in the same amount of GPU memory, which can make a big difference, decreasing memory bandwidth use, or allowing more detail, also mobile devices tend to crash when memory fills up. Compressed textures do not need to be decoded before use which reduces CPU load, noticable when many textures are loaded. Compressed textures include mipmaps, further reducing CPU load by avoiding mipmap generation step, noticable when many textures are loaded. On the downside: Compressed textures can be somewhat bigger and slower than JPEGs to load over the network. Actual number should be verified but as an example, compressed texture formats might achieve about 4-6x compression, compared to say 15x compression for JPEG. Compression tends to be relatively slow. In combination with some IP issues this usually makes it impractical to create GPU compressed textures on the fly. Since different devices have different GPUs that support different compressed texture formats, one typically has to provide compressed textures in multiple formats and decide which ones to load at runtime (although basis avoids this problem). Container Formats Texture Containers  This section is based on the information in Dave Evan's helpful Texture Containers article, please refer to it for additional details. Non-texture image formats do not support storing mipmap chains. When loading a JPG or a PNG, mipmaps must be generated by resizing the original image repeatedly for each required mipmap level. In contrast, a single texture container can store all the data required for an entire texture, mipmaps, array layers or cubemap faces. Generating mipmaps offline is important if you use compressed textures, as it’s generally impractical to generate compressed textures at runtime. The main container formats for compressed textures are the Khronos Texture format (KTX) and Microsoft's DirectDraw Surface (DDS). KTX, being a standard, is better specified and therefore recommended. KTX (Khronos Texture) The KTX format is a Khronos Group standard for storing textures. It can store 1D, 2D, 3D, Cubemaps and Array Textures, along with any number of mipmaps for these textures. This makes it ideal for storing almost any kind of texture you could want. The fields in the KTX header are directly compatible with other Khronos standards such as WebGL. The texture data is described in the  glType ,  glFormat ,  glInternalFormat , and  glBaseInternalFormat  header fields. These should match up with the parameters to the  gl[Compressed]Tex[Sub]Image*  calls used to submit each texture mipmap level’s data. Khronos KTX Specification Khronos KTX Software DDS (DirectDraw Surface) The DDS format is in common use for storing textures (despite DirectDraw being long deprecated). Originally only 2D textures were supported, but the D3D10 header extension added support for texture arrays and D3D10+ features. The format is partially documented on MSDN. MSDN: Programming Guide for DDS PVR (PowerVR) The PVR texture compression format defines its own container http://cdn.imgtec.com/sdk-documentation/PVR+File+Format.Specification.pdf Compression Formats As mentioned the actual compressed subimages are not parsed or modified by loaders.gl, however loaders.gl attempts to identify the formats using metadata and return the appropiate format fields to facilitate use in WebGL and WebGPU. The following is the typical list of compressed texture formats, which loaders.gl can properly tag: Format Description `S3TC S3 texture compression formats `S3TC_SRGB S3 SRGB texture compression formats `PVRTC PowerVR texture compression formats `ETC1 texture compression formats `ETC texture compression formats ASTC texture compression formats `ATC AMD texture compression formats Recommnended Formats The following could be a starting point for choosing texture formats Desktop: BC3 ( DXT5 ) - transparent textures with full alpha range BC1 ( DXT1 ) - opaque textures iOS: PVR4  - transparent textures with alpha PVR2  - opaque textures Android: ASTC_4x4 ,  ASTC8x8  - transparent textures with full alpha range ETC1  - opaque textures Using Compressed Textures Compressed textures are designed to be directly uploaded to GPUs that have the required decoding support implemented in hardware. Using compressed textures in JS loaders.gl currently does not provide CPU-side decoding capabilities for compressed textures, meaning that they can only be uploaded directly to supporting GPUs. Use a WebGL context and read back the rendered texture to the client. Using Compressed Textures in luma.gl While loaders.gl itself is framework-independent, luma.gl (and other vis.gl frameworks like deck.gl) are designed to seamless consume data loaded by loaders.gl. Data returned by any loaders.gl \"image\" category loader (including texture loaders) can be passed directly to luma.gl  Texture2D  class.

At the time of writing, only S3 texture compression has been specified: Creating Compressed Textures Texture compression code is usually not readily available, particulary not in JavaScript. Compression is typically done by binary programs, e.g.  PVRTexTool . The loaders.gl  CompressedTextureWriter  can compress textures (under Node.js only) by executing a binary with the appropriate command line, and then loading back the output. IP and Patent Considerations An issue with compressed texture formats is that they tend to be highly propietary and patent-encumbered, and while it is usually no longer an issue, there can be cases where e.g. royalty requirements come into play when using them. To side-step patent issues when using these formats an application would typically: Generate compressed textures in external applications (which should already have licensed any required formats and libraries). Load them in binary form without touching the content. Pass them directly to a texture, so that they are processed inside the GPU driver (which should also habe licensed the supported formats and libraries).","headings":[{"value":"About Compressed Textures","depth":1},{"value":"Performance Considerations","depth":2},{"value":"Container Formats","depth":2},{"value":"KTX (Khronos Texture)","depth":3},{"value":"DDS (DirectDraw Surface)","depth":3},{"value":"PVR (PowerVR)","depth":3},{"value":"Compression Formats","depth":2},{"value":"Recommnended Formats","depth":3},{"value":"Using Compressed Textures","depth":2},{"value":"Using compressed textures in JS","depth":3},{"value":"Using Compressed Textures in luma.gl","depth":3},{"value":"Using Compressed Textures in raw WebGL","depth":3},{"value":"WebGL Extensions","depth":3},{"value":"Using Compressed Textures in WebGPU","depth":3},{"value":"Creating Compressed Textures","depth":2},{"value":"IP and Patent Considerations","depth":2}],"slug":"modules/textures/docs/using-compressed-textures","title":"About Compressed Textures"},{"excerpt":"@loaders.gl/terrain loaders.gl  is a collection of framework-independent 3D and geospatial parsers and encoders.

Older browsers (mainly Edge and IE11) as well as versions of Node.js prior to v12 do not provide certain classes that loaders.gl depends on. Note that while  @loaders.gl/polyfills  is designed to work seamlessly with other loaders.gl modules, using it is not a requirement. There are other good polyfill modules available on  npm  that can be used in its place. Installation Usage Just import  @loaders.gl/polyfills  before you start using other loaders.gl modules. To use the experimental  Blob  and  File  polyfills Included Polyfills Polyfill Node Browser Comments TextEncoder / TextDecoder Node.js < 11 Yes (Older browsers) Only UTF8 is guaranteed to be supported atob / btoa All versions No Note: these functions are  not unicode safe , but OK to use for test cases. fetch All versions No A subset of the fetch API is supported, see below.

Files ending with  .gz  are automatically decompressed with gzip decompression (this is only done on Node.js, in the browser the content-encoding header must be set). The Node.js  fetch  is able to follow 30X redirect: if  Response  has status 300-399 and  location  header is set, the  fetch  polyfill re-requests data from  location . TextEncoder and TextDecoder Polyfills TextEncoder  and  TextDecoder  polyfills are provided to ensure these APIs are always available. In modern browsers these will evaluate to the built-in objects of the same name, however under Node.js polyfills are transparently installed. Note: The provided polyfills only guarantee UTF8 support. Remarks Applications should only install this module if they need to run under older environments. While the polyfills are only installed at runtime if the platform does not already support them, importing this module will increase the application's bundle size. Refer to browser documentation for the usage of these classes, e.g. MDN. In the browser, overhead of using these imports is not as high, as most polyfills are only bundled under Node.js. If working under older browsers, e.g. IE11, you may need to install your own TextEncoder/TextDecoder polyfills before loading this library Attribution The  Header  polyfill (for Node.js  fetch ) is a fork of the implementation in  https://github.com/github/fetch  (MIT license).

These functions are intended to be called on raw  ArrayBuffer  data, before the  ImageLoader  parses it and converts it to a parsed image type. These functions are used internally to autodetect if image loader can be used to parse a certain  ArrayBuffer , but are also available to applications. Function Description isBinaryImage(imageData : ArrayBuffer [, mimeType : String]) : Boolean `getBinaryImageMIMEType(imageData : ArrayBuffer) : String null` getBinaryImageSize(imageData : ArrayBuffer [, mimeType : String]) : Object Parsed Image API A set of functions to work with parsed images returned by the  ImageLoader .

These functions take a  getUrl  parameter that enables the app to supply the url for each \"sub-image\", and return a single promise enabling applications to for instance load all the faces of a cube texture, with one image for each mip level for each face in a single async operation. Function Description loadImage Load a single image loadImageArray Load an array of images, e.g. for a  Texture2DArray  or  Texture3D loadImageCube Load a map of 6 images for the faces of a cube map, or a map of 6 arrays of images for the mip levels of the 6 faces. As with all loaders.gl functions, while these functions are intended for use in WebGL applications, they do not call any WebGL functions, and do not actually create any WebGL textures.. Image Types To support image loading on older browsers and Node.js, the  ImageLoader  can return different types, i.e. different representations of the parsed image. ImageBitmap  - An  ImageBitmap  object represents a bitmap image that can be performantly painted to a canvas (\"without undue latency\"). Due to the signficant performance advantages, and the fact that  ImageBitmap  instances can be transferred efficiently between threads,  ImageBitmap  is the preferred parsed image representation in browsers, when available. Currently only available in Chrome and Firefox. Image  (aka  HTMLImageElement ) - The traditional HTML image class. Available in all browsers. data  - Raw binary memory representing the image pixels, typically in RGBA  Uint8Array  format. JavaScript computations can be done on this data. Also, Node.js texture creation functions in headless gl accept  data  images. and browser  ImageData  objects can be initialized with this data.

Installation Optionally, to support Draco encoded gltf files GLTFScenegraph API To simplify traversing and building glTF data objects, the  GLTFScenegraph  class can be used. A glTF data object can also be built programmatically using the GLTFScenegraph's \"fluent API\": GLTF Post Processing The  postProcessGLTF  function implements a number of transformations on the loaded glTF data that would typically need to be performed by the application after loading the data, and is provided as an optional function that applications can call after loading glTF data. Refer to the reference page for details on what transformations are performed. Context: the glTF data object returned by the GLTF loader contains the \"raw\" glTF JSON structure (to ensure generality and \"data fidelity\" reasons). However, most applications that are going to use the glTF data to visualize it in (typically in WebGL) will need to do some processing of the loaded data before using it. Using GLB as a \"Binary Container\" for Arbitrary Data The GLB binary container format used by glTF addresses a general need to store a mix of JSON and binary data, and can potentially be used as a foundation for building custom loaders and writers. To allow for this (and also to generally improve the glTF code structure), the  GLTFLoader  and  GLTFBuilder  classes are built on top of GLB focused classes ( GLBLoader  and  GLBBuilder ) that can be used independently of the bigger glTF classes. glTF Extension Support Certain glTF extensions are fully or partially supported by the glTF classes.

Can load both the  .glb  (binary) and  .gltf  (application/json) file format variants. A glTF file contains a hierarchical scenegraph description that can be used to instantiate corresponding hierarcy of actual  Scenegraph  related classes in most WebGL libraries. Loader Characteristic File Extensions .glb ,  .gltf File Type Binary, JSON, Linked Assets File Format glTF v2 ,  GLTF v1   * Data Format Scenegraph Supported APIs load ,  parse Subloaders DracoLoader ,  ImageLoader *  From  , the  GLTFLoader  offers optional, best-effort support for converting older glTF v1 files to glTF v2 format ( options.gltf.normalize: true ). This conversion has a number of limitations and the parsed data structure may be only partially converted to glTF v2, causing issues to show up later e.g. when attempting to render the scenegraphs. Usage To decompress Draco-compressed meshes: Overview The  GLTFLoader  aims to take care of as much processing as possible, while remaining framework-independent. The GLTF Loader returns an object with a  json  field containing the glTF Scenegraph. In its basic mode, the  GLTFLoader  does not modify the loaded JSON in any way. Instead, the results of additional processing are placed in parallel top-level fields such as  buffers  and  images . This ensures that applications that want to work with the standard glTF data structure can do so. Optionally, the loaded gltf can be \"post processed\", which lightly annotates and transforms the loaded JSON structure to make it easier to use. Refer to  postProcessGLTF  for details. In addition, certain glTF extensions, in particular Draco mesh encoding, can be fully or partially processed during loading. When possible (and extension processing is enabled), such extensions will be resolved/decompressed and replaced with standards conformant representations. See  glTF Extensions  for more information. Note: while supported, synchronous parsing of glTF (e.g. using  parseSync() ) has significant limitations. When parsed asynchronously (using  await parse()  or  await load() ), the following additional capabilities are enabled: linked binary resource URI:s will be loaded and resolved (assuming a valid base url is available). base64 encoded binary URI:s inside the JSON payload will be decoded. linked image URI:s can be loaded and decoded. Draco meshes can be decoded asynchronously on worker threads (in parallel!). Options Option Type Default Description gltf.loadBuffers Boolean false Fetch any referenced binary buffer files (and decode base64 encoded URIS). gltf.loadImages Boolean false Load any referenced image files (and decode base64 encoded URIS). gltf.decompressMeshes Boolean true Decompress Draco compressed meshes (if DracoLoader available). gltf.postProcess Boolean true Perform additional post processing on the loaded glTF data. gltf.normalize Boolean false Optional, best-effort attempt at converting glTF v1 files to glTF2 format. Remarks: The  gltf.postProcess  option activates additional  post processing  that transforms parts of JSON structure in the loaded glTF data, to make glTF data easier use in applications and WebGL libraries (e.g replacing indices with links to the indexed objects). However, the data structure returned by the  GLTFLoader  will no longer be fully glTF compatible. Data Format With Post Processing When the  GLTFLoader  is called with  gltf.postProcess  option set to  true  (the default),the parsed JSON chunk will be returned, and  post processing  will have been performed, which will link data from binary buffers into the parsed JSON structure using non-standard fields, and also modify the data in other ways to make it easier to use. At the top level, this will look like a standard glTF JSON structure: However, the objects inside these arrays will have been pre-processed to simplify usage. For details on changes and extra fields added to the various glTF objects, see  post processing . Without Post Processing By setting  gltf.postProcess  to  false , an unprocessed glTF/GLB data structure will be returned, with binary buffers provided as an  ArrayBuffer  array.

It adds loaded buffers and images to the glTF JSON objects It creates typed arrays for buffer views Usage Postprocessing is done by default by the  GLTFLoader : To turn post processing off, and then optionally post process via  postProcessGLTF  function: After post-processing, the gltf scenegraphs are now easier to iterate over as indices have been resolved to object references: Functions postProcessGLTF(gltf : Object, options? : Object) : Object gltf  is expected to have  json  and  buffers  fields per the GLTF Data Format Category. options.uri  - Set base URI (for image loading) The GLTF post processor copies objects in the input gltf json field as necessary to avoid modifying the input JSON, but does not do a deep copy on sub-objects that do not need to be modified. General Post Processing Replace indices with references The first thing that  postProcessGLTF  does is replace glTF indices with object references to simplify iteration over the scenegraph. Background: The GLTF file format describes a tree structure, however it links nodes through numeric indices rather than direct references. (As an example the  nodes  field in the top-level glTF  scenegraph  array is an array of indices into the top-level  nodes  array. Each node has a  mesh  attribute that is an index into to the  meshes  array, and so on). Adds  id  to every node The postprocessor makes sure each node and an  id  value, unless already present. Node Specific Post Processing Buffers The following fields will be populated from the supplied  gltf.buffers  parameter (this parameter is populated by the loader via  options.loadLinkedResources: true ): buffer.arrayBuffer  - buffer.byteOffset  - buffer.byteLength  - BufferViews bufferView.data  - Typed arrays ( Uint8Arrays ) will be created for buffer views and stored in this field. These typed arrays can be used to upload data to WebGL buffers. Accessors The accessor parameters which are textual strings in glTF will be resolved into WebGL constants (which are just numbers, e.g.  5126  =  GL.FLOAT ), to prepare for use with WebGL frameworks. accessor.value  - This will be set to a typed array that is a view into the underlying bufferView. Remarks: While it can be very convenient to initialize WebGL buffers from  accessor.value , this approach will defeat any memory sharing on the GPU that the glTF file specifies through accessors sharing  bufferViews . The canonical way of instantitating a glTF model is for an application to create one WebGL buffer for each  bufferView  and then use accessors to reference data chunks inside those WebGL buffers with  offset  and  stride . Images image.image  - Populated from the supplied  gltf.images  array. This array is populated by the  GLTFLoader  via  options.loadImages: true ): image.uri  - If loaded image in the  images  array is not available, uses  gltf.baseUri  or  options.baseUri  is available, to resolve a relative URI and replaces this value. Materials ...texture  - Since each texture object in the material has an  ...index  field next to other fields, the post processor will add a  ...texture  field instead of replacing the  ...index  field.

It is intended to help e.g. in situations like getting test cases to load data from the right place, but was never intended to support general application use cases. The stream utilities are intended to be small optional helpers that facilitate writing platform independent code that works with streams. This can be valuable as JavaScript Stream APIs are still maturing and there are still significant differences between platforms.

This feature is built-in to the  parse  and  load  functions, but applications can also access this feature directly through the  selectLoader  API. Loader selection heuristics are based on: Filename (or url) extensions MIME types (extracted from  Response   content-type  headers or  Blob.type / File.type  fields) Initial data - for certain inputs, the intial bytes can be compared against known headers for the candidate loaders. (Does not work for  Response / Stream / AsyncIterator  data). selectLoader  is also aware of the  loader registry . If no loaders are provided (by passing in a falsy value such as  null )  selectLoader  will search the list of pre-registered loaders. selectLoaderSync  is also aware of the  loader registry . If no loaders are provided (by passing in a falsy value such as  null )  selectLoader  will search the list of pre-registered loaders. Usage Select a loader from a list of provided loaders: Select a loader from pre-registered loaders in the loader registry: Select a loader by specifying MIME type (using unregistered MIME types, see below) The async  selectLoader  function can identify loaders without extension and mimeType by content sniffing  Blob  and  File  objects (useful when user drags and drops files into your application). Functions selectLoader(data: Response | ArrayBuffer | String | Blob, ..., loaders?: LoaderObject[], options?: object, context?: object): Promise<boolean> Selects an appropriate loader for a file from a list of candidate loaders by examining the  data  parameter, looking at URL extension, mimeType ('Content-Type') and/or an initial data chunk. Parameters: data  - data to perform autodetection against loaders  - can be a single loader or an array of loaders, or null. options.nothrow = false  - Return null instead of throwing exception if no loader can be found Returns: A single loader (or  null  if  options.nothrow  was set and no matching loader was found). Throws: If no matching loader was found, and  options.nothrow  was not set. Regarding the  loaders  parameter: A single loader object will be returned without matching. a  null  loader list will use the pre-registered list of loaders. A supplied list of loaders will be searched for a matching loader. selectLoaderSync(data: Response | ArrayBuffer | String | Blob, ..., loaders?: LoaderObject[], options?: object, context?: object): boolean Supported Formats strings / non-data urls: strings / data urls: The mime type will be extracted from the data url prologue (if available) fetch  Response  objects:  url  and  headers.get('Content-Type')  fields will be used. File  and  Blob  objects: Peeking into batched input sources is not supported directly by  selectLoader : Response : Avoids requesting initial data to make sure the response body is not marked as used. Stream : It is not possible to non-destructively peek into a stream. Iterator/AsyncIterator : it is not possible to peek into an iterator. Instead use helpers to get access to initialContents and pass it in separately. MIME types If the standard MIME types for each format are not precise enough, loaders.gl also supports  unregistered  MIME types. Each loader will match the  application/x.<id>  where the  <id>  is the documented  id  of the loader, e.g.  application/x.ply / application/x.draco /etc ... Remarks File extensions - An attempt will be made to extract a file extension by stripping away query parameters and base path before matching against known loader extensions.

This promise is resolved at the end of the frame before the first frame the tileset is rendered in. url : String (readonly) The url to a tileset JSON file. basePath : String (readonly) (deprecated) The base path that non-absolute paths in tileset JSON file are relative to. maximumScreenSpaceError The maximum screen space error used to drive level of detail refinement. This value helps determine when a tile refines to its descendants, and therefore plays a major role in balancing performance with visual quality. A tile's screen space error is roughly equivalent to the number of pixels wide that would be drawn if a sphere with a\nradius equal to the tile's  geometric error  were rendered at the tile's position. If this value exceeds\n maximumScreenSpaceError  the tile refines to its descendants. Depending on the tileset,  maximumScreenSpaceError  may need to be tweaked to achieve the right balance. Higher values provide better performance but lower visual quality. maximumMemoryUsage : Number ^default 16 ^exception  maximumScreenSpaceError  must be greater than or equal to zero. The maximum amount of GPU memory (in MB) that may be used to cache tiles. This value is estimated from\ngeometry, textures, and batch table textures of loaded tiles.

If decreasing this value results in unloading tiles, the tiles are unloaded the next frame. If tiles sized more than  maximumMemoryUsage  are needed\nto meet the desired screen space error, determined by  Tileset3D.maximumScreenSpaceError  ,\nfor the current view, then the memory usage of the tiles loaded will exceed\n maximumMemoryUsage .  For example, if the maximum is 256 MB, but\n300 MB of tiles are needed to meet the screen space error, then 300 MB of tiles may be loaded.  When\nthese tiles go out of view, they will be unloaded. ^default 512 ^exception  maximumMemoryUsage  must be greater than or equal to zero.\n^see Tileset3D#gpuMemoryUsageInBytes root : Tile3DHeader The root tile header. boundingSphere : BoundingSphere The tileset's bounding sphere. modelMatrix : Matrix4 A 4x4 transformation matrix that transforms the entire tileset. timeSinceLoad : Number Returns the time, in milliseconds, since the tileset was loaded and first updated. maximumMemoryUsage : Number gpuMemoryUsageInBytes : Number The total amount of GPU memory in bytes used by the tileset. This value is estimated from\ngeometry, texture, and batch table textures of loaded tiles. For point clouds, this value also\nincludes per-point metadata. statistics classificationType (Experimental) readonly Determines whether terrain, 3D Tiles or both will be classified by this tileset. This option is only applied to tilesets containing batched 3D models, geometry data, or vector data. Even when undefined, vector data and geometry data\nmust render as classifications and will default to rendering on both terrain and other 3D Tiles tilesets. When enabled for batched 3D model tilesets, there are a few requirements/limitations on the glTF: This feature is using part of the 3D Tiles spec that is not final and is subject to change without the standard deprecation policy. ellipsoid : Ellipsoid Gets an ellipsoid describing the shape of the globe. Returns the  extras  property at the top-level of the tileset JSON, which contains application specific metadata.\nReturns  undefined  if  extras  does not exist. Exception The tileset is not loaded. Use Tileset3D.readyPromise or wait for Tileset3D.ready to be true. See  Extras  in the 3D Tiles specification.} unloadTileset Unloads all tiles that weren't selected the previous frame. This can be used to\nexplicitly manage the tile cache and reduce the total number of tiles loaded below\n Tileset3D.maximumMemoryUsage . Tile unloads occur at the next frame to keep all the WebGL delete calls\nwithin the render loop. isDestroyed() : Boolean Returns true if this object was destroyed; otherwise, false. If this object was destroyed, it should not be used; calling any function other than\n isDestroyed  will result in an exception. ^returns  Boolean :  true  if this object was destroyed; otherwise,  false . destroy() Destroys the WebGL resources held by this object. Destroying an object allows for deterministic\nrelease of WebGL resources, instead of relying on the garbage collector to destroy this object. Once an object is destroyed, it should not be used; calling any function other than  isDestroyed  will result in an exception. Therefore, assign the return value  undefined  to the object as done in the example. Wxception This object was destroyed, i.e., destroy() was called. Methods constructor(tileset, url, options) tileset  ( Object ) - The loaded tileset (parsed JSON) url  - (`String) The url to a tileset JSON file. options  Options object, see  with the following properties: Notes: The  version  tileset must be 3D Tiles version 0.0 or 1.0. hasExtension(extensionName : String) : Boolean true  if the tileset JSON file lists the extension in extensionsUsed; otherwise,  false .\n^param {String} extensionName The name of the extension to check.  * \n^returns {Boolean}  true  if the tileset JSON file lists the extension in extensionsUsed; otherwise,  false .

Reduce the screen space error for tiles that are further away from the camera. options.dynamicScreenSpaceErrorDensity = 0.00278 ] ( Number ) - Density used to adjust the dynamic screen space error, similar to fog density. options.dynamicScreenSpaceErrorFactor = 4.0 ] ( Number ) - A factor used to increase the computed dynamic screen space error. options.skipLevelOfDetail = true  ( Boolean ) - Optimization option. Determines if level of detail skipping should be applied during the traversal. options.baseScreenSpaceError = 1024  ( Number ) - When  skipLevelOfDetail  is  true , the screen space error that must be reached before skipping levels of detail. options.ellipsoid = Ellipsoid.WGS84  ( Ellipsoid ) - The ellipsoid determining the size and shape of the globe. Callbacks options.onTileLoad  ( void(tileHeader) ) - options.onTileUnload  ( void(tileHeader) ) - options.onTileError  ( void(tileHeader, message : String) ) - dynamicScreenSpaceError = false Optimization option. Whether the tileset should refine based on a dynamic screen space error. Tiles that are further away will be rendered with lower detail than closer tiles. This improves performance by rendering fewer tiles and making less requests, but may result in a slight drop in visual quality for tiles in the distance. The algorithm is biased towards \"street views\" where the camera is close to the ground plane of the tileset and looking at the horizon. In addition results are more accurate for tightly fitting bounding volumes like box and region. dynamicScreenSpaceErrorDensity = 0.00278 A scalar that determines the density used to adjust the dynamic screen space error (similar to \"fog\"). Increasing this value has the effect of increasing the maximum screen space error for all tiles, but in a non-linear fashion. The error starts at 0.0 and increases exponentially until a midpoint is reached, and then approaches 1.0 asymptotically. This has the effect of keeping high detail in the closer tiles and lower detail in the further tiles, with all tiles beyond a certain distance all roughly having an error of 1.0. The dynamic error is in the range [0.0, 1.0) and is multiplied by  dynamicScreenSpaceErrorFactor  to produce the\nfinal dynamic error. This dynamic error is then subtracted from the tile's actual screen space error. Increasing  dynamicScreenSpaceErrorDensity  has the effect of moving the error midpoint closer to the camera.\nIt is analogous to moving fog closer to the camera. dynamicScreenSpaceErrorFactor = 4.0; A factor used to increase the screen space error of tiles for dynamic screen space error. As this value increases less tiles\nare requested for rendering and tiles in the distance will have lower detail. If set to zero, the feature will be disabled. onTileLoad(tileHeader : Tile3DHeader) : void Indicate ssthat a tile's content was loaded. The loaded  Tile3DHeader  is passed to the event listener. This event is fired during the tileset traversal while the frame is being rendered\nso that updates to the tile take effect in the same frame.  Do not create or modify\nentities or primitives during the event listener. onTileUnload(tileHeader : Tile3DHeader) : void Indicates that a tile's content was unloaded. The unloaded  Tile3DHeaders  is passed to the event listener. This event is fired immediately before the tile's content is unloaded while the frame is being\nrendered so that the event listener has access to the tile's content.  Do not create\nor modify entities or primitives during the event listener. See Tileset3D#maximumMemoryUsage Tileset3D#trimLoadedTiles onTileError(tileHeader : Tile3DHeader) : void Called to indicate that a tile's content failed to load. By default, error messages will be logged to the console. The error object passed to the listener contains two properties: url : the url of the failed tile. message : the error message. skipLevelOfDetail : Boolean Default: true Optimization option. Determines if level of detail skipping should be applied during the traversal. The common strategy for replacement-refinement traversal is to store all levels of the tree in memory and require\nall children to be loaded before the parent can refine. With this optimization levels of the tree can be skipped\nentirely and children can be rendered alongside their parents. The tileset requires significantly less memory when\nusing this optimization. baseScreenSpaceError : Number Default: 1024 The screen space error that must be reached before skipping levels of detail. Only used when  skipLevelOfDetail  is  true . skipScreenSpaceErrorFactor : Number Default: 16 Multiplier defining the minimum screen space error to skip.\nFor example, if a tile has screen space error of 100, no tiles will be loaded unless they\nare leaves or have a screen space error  <= 100 / skipScreenSpaceErrorFactor . Only used when  Tileset3D.skipLevelOfDetail  is  true . skipLevels Default: 1 Constant defining the minimum number of levels to skip when loading tiles. When it is 0, no levels are skipped.\nFor example, if a tile is level 1, no tiles will be loaded unless they are at level greater than 2.

API Design Notes Understanding some of the design decisions made when defining the JavaScript binding API may help facilitate a better appreciateion of why the API is designed the way it is: To facilitate keeping the evolution of the JavaScript bindings matched to other bindings, the JavaScript Arrow API is designed to be close match to the C++ Arrow API, although some differences have been made where it makes sense. Some design patterns, like the way  RecordBatchReader.from()  returns different  RecordBatchReader  subclasses depending on what source is being read. Editing Documentation Markdown vs JSDoc Since the Arrow JavaScript API includes both manually written markdown and \"automatically\" generated jsdoc. Some main differences are: The markdown version contains a \"Developer Guide\" which is not present in the jsdoc. The markdown version of the \"API reference\" focuses on readability. It contains more text with semantic descriptions and examples of usage of classes and functions. It also omits more complex typescript annotions for function prototypes to ensure that the API documentation is easy to digest for all JavaScript programmers. The jsdoc version includes the full Typescript type information and is more richly hyperlinked and can be valuable to developers as a supplement to the markdown reference when those particular details matter. Updating Docs In general, the markdown docs should be considered the source of truth for the JavaScript API: To avoid excessive duplication and possible divergence between markdown and JSDoc, it is recommended that the JSDoc version contains brief summary texts only. Reviewers should make sure that PRs affecting the JS API (bothk features and bug fixes) contain appropriate changes to the markdown docs (in the same way that such PRs must contain appropriate changes to e.g. test cases). When appropriate, to ensure the markdown docs remain \"the source of truth\" for the Arrow JS API, bugs should be reviewed first towards the markdown documentation, e.g. to see if the documented behavior is incorrectly specified and needs to be fixed.","headings":[{"value":"Contributing","depth":1},{"value":"API Design Notes","depth":2},{"value":"Editing Documentation","depth":2},{"value":"Markdown vs JSDoc","depth":3},{"value":"Updating Docs","depth":3}],"slug":"arrowjs/docs/contributing","title":"Contributing"},{"excerpt":"Introduction The Arrow JavaScript API is designed to helps applications tap into the full power of working with binary columnar data in the Apache Arrow format. Arrow JS has a rich set of classes that supports use cases such as batched loading and writing, as well performing data frame operations on Arrow encoded data, including applying filters, iterating over tables, etc. Getting Started To install and start coding with Apache Arrow JS bindings, see the  Getting Started . About Apache Arrow Apache Arrow is a performance-optimized binary columnar memory layout specification for encoding vectors and table-like containers of flat and nested data. The Arrow spec is design to eliminate memory copies and aligns columnar data in memory to minimize cache misses and take advantage of the latest SIMD (Single input multiple data) and GPU operations on modern processors. Apache Arrow is emerging as the standard for large in-memory columnar data (Spark, Pandas, Drill, Graphistry, ...). By standardizing on a common binary interchange format, big data systems can reduce the costs and friction associated with cross-system communication. Resources There are some excellent resources available that can help you quickly get a feel for what capabilities the Arrow JS API offers: Observable:  Introduction to Apache Arrow Observable:  Using Apache Arrow JS with Large Datasets Observable:  Manipulating Flat Arrays, Arrow-Style Manipulating Flat Arrays  General article on Columnar Data and Data Frames Apache Arrow project links: Apache Arrow Home Apache Arrow JS on github Apache Arrow JS on npm","headings":[{"value":"Introduction","depth":1},{"value":"Getting Started","depth":2},{"value":"About Apache Arrow","depth":2},{"value":"Resources","depth":2}],"slug":"arrowjs/docs","title":"Introduction"},{"excerpt":"Roadmap What's Next for Apache Arrow in Javascript There are a lot of features we'd like to add over the next few Javascript releases: Inline predicates : Function calls in the inner loop of a scan over millions of records can be very expensive. We can potentially save that time by generating a new scan function with the predicates inlined when a filter is created. Cache filter results : Right now every time we do a scan on a filtered DataFrame we re-check the predicate on every row. There should be an (optional?) lazily computed index to store the predicate results for subsequent re-use. Friendlier API : I shouldn't have to write a custom scan function just to take a look at the results of a filter! Every DataFrame should have a toJSON() function (See ARROW-2202). node.js ↔ (Python, C++, Java, ...) interaction : A big benefit of Arrow's common in-memory format is that different tools can operate on the same memory. Unfortunately we're pretty closed off in the browser, but node doesn't have that problem! Finishing ARROW-1700, node.js Plasma store client should make this type of interaction possible. Have an idea? Tell us! Generally JIRAs are preferred but we'll take GitHub issues too. If you just want to discuss something, reach out on the mailing list or slack. But PRs are the best of all, we can always use more contributors! Feature Completeness Ideally each Apache Arrow language binding would offer the same set of features, at least to the extent that the language/platform in question allows. In practice however, not all features have been implemented in all language bindings. In comparison with the C++ Arrow API bindings, there are some missing features in the JavaScript bindings: Tensors are not yet supported.

Arrow represents columns of values in sets of contiguous buffers. This is in contrast to a row-oriented representation, where the values for each row are stored in a contiguous buffer. The columnar representation makes it easier to take advantage of SIMD instruction sets in modern CPUs and GPUs, and can lead to dramatic performance improvements processing large amounts of data. Components The Arrow library is organized into separate components responsible for creating, reading, writing, serializing, deserializing, or manipulating Tables or Columns. Data Types  - Classes that define the fixed-width, variable-width, and composite data types Arrow can represent Vectors  - Classes to read and decode JavaScript values from the underlying buffers or Vectors for each data type Builders  - Classes to write and encode JavaScript values into the underlying buffers or Vectors for each data type Visitors  - Classes to traverse, manipulate, read, write, or aggregate values from trees of Arrow Vectors or DataTypes IPC Readers and Writers  - Classes to read and write the Arrow IPC (inter-process communication) binary file and stream formats Fields, Schemas, RecordBatches, Tables, and Columns  - Classes to describe, manipulate, read, and write groups of strongly-typed Vectors or Columns Data Types At the heart of Arrow is set of well-known logical  data types , ensuring each Column in an Arrow Table is strongly-typed. These data types define how a Column's underlying buffers should be constructed and read, and includes configurable (and custom) metadata fields for further annotating a Column. A Schema describing each Column's name and data type is encoded alongside each Column's data buffers, allowing you to consume an Arrow data source without knowing the data types or column layout beforehand. Each data type falls into one of three rough categories: Fixed-width types, variable-width types, or composite types that contain other Arrow data types. All data types can represent null values, which are stored in a separate validity  bitmask . Follow the links below for a more detailed description of each data type. Fixed-width Data Types Fixed-width data types describe physical primitive values (bytes or bits of some fixed size), or logical values that can be represented as primitive values. In addition to an optional  Uint8Array  validity bitmask, these data types have a physical data buffer (a  TypedArray  corresponding to the data type's physical element width). Null  - A column of NULL values having no physical storage Bool  - Booleans as either 0 or 1 (bit-packed, LSB-ordered) Int  - Signed or unsigned 8, 16, 32, or 64-bit little-endian integers Float  - 2, 4, or 8-byte floating point values Decimal  - Precision-and-scale-based 128-bit decimal values FixedSizeBinary  - A list of fixed-size binary sequences, where each value occupies the same number of bytes Date  - Date as signed 32-bit integer days or 64-bit integer milliseconds since the UNIX epoch Time  - Time as signed 32 or 64-bit integers, representing either seconds, millisecond, microseconds, or nanoseconds since midnight (00:00:00) Timestamp  - Exact timestamp as signed 64-bit integers, representing either seconds, milliseconds, microseconds, or nanoseconds since the UNIX epoch Interval  - Time intervals as pairs of either (year, month) or (day, time) in SQL style FixedSizeList  - Fixed-size sequences of another logical Arrow data type Variable-width Data Types Variable-width types describe lists of values with different widths, including binary blobs, Utf8 code-points, or slices of another underlying Arrow data type. These types store the values contiguously in memory, and have a physical  Int32Array  of offsets that describe the start and end indicies of each list element. List  - Variable-length sequences of another logical Arrow data type Utf8  - Variable-length byte sequences of UTF8 code-points (strings) Binary  - Variable-length byte sequences (no guarantee of UTF8-ness) Composite Data Types Composite types don't have physical data buffers of their own. They contain other Arrow data types and delegate work to them. Union  - Union of logical child data types Map  - Map of named logical child data types Struct  - Struct of ordered logical child data types","headings":[{"value":"Introduction","depth":1},{"value":"Components","depth":2},{"value":"Data Types","depth":2},{"value":"Fixed-width Data Types","depth":3},{"value":"Variable-width Data Types","depth":3},{"value":"Composite Data Types","depth":3}],"slug":"arrowjs/docs/paul-drafts/introduction","title":"Introduction"},{"excerpt":"Examples Some short examples Get a table from an Arrow file on disk (in IPC format) Create a Table when the Arrow file is split across buffers Create a Table from JavaScript arrays Load data with  fetch Columns look like JS Arrays","headings":[{"value":"Examples","depth":1},{"value":"Get a table from an Arrow file on disk (in IPC format)","depth":3},{"value":"Create a Table when the Arrow file is split across buffers","depth":3},{"value":"Create a Table from JavaScript arrays","depth":3},{"value":"Load data with fetch","depth":3},{"value":"Columns look like JS Arrays","depth":3}],"slug":"arrowjs/docs/get-started/examples","title":"Examples"},{"excerpt":"What's New v0.4.1 TBA v0.4.0 TBA v0.3.0 TBA v0.3.0 TBA","headings":[{"value":"What's New","depth":1},{"value":"v0.4.1","depth":1},{"value":"v0.4.0","depth":1},{"value":"v0.3.0","depth":1},{"value":"v0.3.0","depth":1}],"slug":"arrowjs/docs/whats-new","title":"What's New"},{"excerpt":"Installing Installing Arrow JS The Apache Arrow JS bindings are published as an npm module.

If the JavaScript platform supports the recently introduced  BigInt64Array  typed array, Arrow JS will use this type. For convenience ArrowJS inject additional methods (on the object instance) that lets it be converted to JSON, strings, values and primitives bigIntArray.toJSON() bigIntArray.toString() bigIntArray.valueOf() bigIntArray[Symbol.toPrimitive](hint: 'string' | 'number' | 'default') Notes about Conversion Methods When you have one of the wide numeric types ( Int64 ,  Uint64 , or  Decimal  which is 128bit), those  Vector  instances always return/accept subarray slices of the underlying 32bit typed arrays. But to make life easier for people consuming the typed arrays, the Arrow JS API adds some  extra methods  to the typed arrays before they're returned. The goal of these methods is to handle conversion to and from the various primitive types ( number ,  string ,  bigint , and  JSON.stringify() ) so people usually \"fall into the pit of success\". One of the added methods is an implementation of  [Symbol.toPrimitive] , which JS will use when doing certain kinds of implicit primitive coercion.  The implementation of these methods is  bifurcated , so if you're in an environment with  BigInt  support we use the native type, but if not, we'll make a best-effort attempt to return something meaningful (usually the unsigned decimal representation of the number as a string, though we'd appreciate help if someone knows how to compute the signed decimal representation).

This allows data frame operations to be extremely performant, even when applied on very big (multi-gigabyte) data aset. Note that the Arrow JS  Table  class inherits from the  DataFrame  class which is why the examples in this section can use  DataFrame  methods to  Table  instances. Also, most of the data frame operations do not modify the original  Table  or  DataFrame , but rather return a new similar object with new filtering or \"iteration constraints\" applied. So memory is usually not changed or modified during these operations. References: Much of the text in this section is adapted from Brian Hulette's  Introduction to Apache Arrow Removing Rows A simplest way to remove rows from a data frame mey be use  Table.slice(start, end) . As usual, rather than actually modifying memory, this operation returns a new  Table / DataFrame  with iteration constrained to a sub set of the rows in the original frame. Removing Columns The  Table.select(keys: String[])  method drops all columns except the columns with names that match the supplied  keys . Filtering Rows Another way to \"remove\" rows from data frames is to apply filters. Filters effectively \"removes\" rows that don't fullfill the predicates in the filter. For details see the note below. The predicates classes provided by arrow allows for the comparison of column values against literals or javascript values (equality, greater or equal than, less or equal than) as well as the creation of composite logical expressions ( and ,  or  and  not ) out of individual column comparisons. It is also possible to write custom predicates by supplying an arbitrary JavaScript function to filter a row, however performance is usually best when using the built-in comparison predicates. Note that calling  filter()  on a  DataFrame  doesn't actually remove any rows from the underlying data store (it just stores the predicates). It's not until you iterate over the date, e.g. by calling  countBy()  or  scan()  that we actually apply the filter on the rows. Counting Rows To count the number of times different values appear in a table, use  countBy() . Note that  countBy()  does not return a modified data frame or table, but instead returns a new  Table  that contains two columns,  value  and  count . Each distinct value in the specified column in the original table is listed once in  value , and the corresponding  count  field in the same row indicates how many times it was present in the original table. Note that the results are not sorted. Sorting DataFrames do not currently support sorting. To sort you need to move the data back to JavaScript arrays. Iterating over a DataFrame (Scanning) The  DataFrame.scan()  method lets you define a custom function that will be called for each (non-filtered) record in the  DataFrame . Note: For simpler use cases, it is recommended to use the Arrow API provided predicates etc rather than writing a custom scan function, as performance will often be better. Writing a  next  callback for  scan() In order to be more efficient, Arrow data is broken up into batches of records (which is what makes it possible to do concatenations despite the columnar layout, and  DataFrame.scan()  does not hide this implementation detail from you. Optimizing  scan()  performance with  bind()  callbacks In addition to the  next  callback, you can supply a  bind  function for scan to call each time it starts reading from a new  RecordBatch .  scan  will call these functions as illustrated in the following pseudo-code: Note: The  index  passed to next only applies to the current RecordBatch, it is not a global index. The current  RecordBatch  is passed to  next , so it is possible to access data without writing a bind function, but there will be a performance penalty if your data has a lot of batches.","headings":[{"value":"Data Frame Operations","depth":1},{"value":"Removing Rows","depth":2},{"value":"Removing Columns","depth":2},{"value":"Filtering Rows","depth":2},{"value":"Counting Rows","depth":2},{"value":"Sorting","depth":2},{"value":"Iterating over a DataFrame (Scanning)","depth":2},{"value":"Writing a next callback for scan()","depth":3},{"value":"Optimizing scan() performance with bind() callbacks","depth":3}],"slug":"arrowjs/docs/developer-guide/data-frame-operations","title":"Data Frame Operations"},{"excerpt":"Extracting Data While keeping data in Arrow format allows for efficient data frame operations, there are of course cases where data needs to be extracted in a form that can be use with non-Arrow-aware JavaScript code.

Extracting Data by Row You can get a temporary object representing a row in a table. Note that the  row  does not retain the schema, so you'll either need to know the order of columns  row.get(0) , or use the  to*()  methods.

The RecordBatchWriter is conceptually a \"transform\" stream that transforms Tables or RecordBatches into binary  Uint8Array  chunks that represent the Arrow IPC messages ( Schema ,  DictionaryBatch ,  RecordBatch , and in the case of the File format,  Footer  messages). These binary chunks are buffered inside the  RecordBatchWriter  instance until they are consumed, typically by piping the RecordBatchWriter instance to a Writable Stream (like a file or socket), enumerating the chunks via async-iteration, or by calling  toUint8Array()  to create a single contiguous buffer of the concatenated results once the desired Tables or RecordBatches have been written. RecordBatchWriter conforms to the  AsyncIterableIterator  protocol in all environments, and supports two additional stream primitives based on the environment (nodejs or browsers) available at runtime. In nodejs, the  RecordBatchWriter  can be converted to a  ReadableStream , piped to a  WritableStream , and has a static method that returns a  TransformStream  suitable in chained  pipe  calls. browser environments that support the  DOM/WhatWG Streams Standard , corresponding methods exist to convert  RecordBatchWriters  to the DOM  ReadableStream ,  WritableStream , and  TransformStream  variants.

Usage Table.new()  accepts an  Object  of  Columns  or  Vectors , where the keys will be used as the field names for the  Schema : It also accepts a a list of Vectors with an optional list of names or\nFields for the resulting Schema. If the list is omitted or a name is\nmissing, the numeric index of each Vector will be used as the name: If the supplied arguments are  Column  instances,  Table.new  will infer the  Schema  from the  Column s: If the supplied Vector or Column lengths are unequal,  Table.new  will\nextend the lengths of the shorter Columns, allocating additional bytes\nto represent the additional null slots. The memory required to allocate\nthese additional bitmaps can be computed as: For example, an additional null bitmap for one million null values would require  125,000  bytes ( ((1e6 + 63) & ~63) >> 3 ), or approx.  0.11MiB Inheritance Table  extends Chunked Static Methods Table.empty() : Table Creates an empty table Table.from() : Table Creates an empty table Table.from(source: RecordBatchReader): Table Table.from(source:  Promise<RecordBatchReader> ):  Promise<Table> Table.from(source?: any) : Table Table.fromAsync(source: import('./ipc/reader').FromArgs):  Promise<Table> Table.fromVectors(vectors: any[], names?: String[]) : Table Table.fromStruct(struct: Vector) : Table Table.new(columns: Object) Table.new(...columns) Table.new(vectors: Vector[], names: String[]) Type safe constructors. Functionally equivalent to calling  new Table()  with the same arguments, however if using Typescript using the  new  method instead will ensure that types inferred from the arguments \"flow through\" into the return Table type. Members schema (readonly) The  Schema  of this table. length : Number (readonly) The number of rows in this table. TBD: this does not consider filters chunks : RecordBatch[]  ( readonly) The list of chunks in this table. numCols : Number (readonly) The number of columns in this table.

An abstract base class for vector types. Can support a null map ... TBD Inheritance Fields data:  Data<T>  (readonly) The underlying Data instance for this Vector. numChildren: number (readonly) The number of logical Vector children. Only applicable if the DataType of the Vector is one of the nested types (List, FixedSizeList, Struct, or Map). type : T The DataType that describes the elements in the Vector typeId : T 'typeId' The  typeId  enum value of the  type  instance length : number Number of elements in the  Vector offset : number Offset to the first element in the underlying data. stride : number Stride between successive elements in the the underlying data. The number of elements in the underlying data buffer that constitute a single logical value for the given type. The stride for all DataTypes is 1 unless noted here: For  Decimal  types, the stride is 4. For  Date  types, the stride is 1 if the  unit  is DateUnit.DAY, else 2. For  Int ,  Interval , or  Time  types, the stride is 1 if  bitWidth <= 32 , else 2. For  FixedSizeList  types, the stride is the  listSize  property of the  FixedSizeList  instance. For  FixedSizeBinary  types, the stride is the  byteWidth  property of the  FixedSizeBinary  instance. nullCount : Number Number of  null  values in this  Vector  instance ( null  values require a null map to be present). VectorName : String Returns the name of the Vector ArrayType : TypedArrayConstructor | ArrayConstructor Returns the constructor of the underlying typed array for the values buffer as determined by this Vector's DataType. values : T 'TArray' Returns the underlying data buffer of the Vector, if applicable. typeIds : Int8Array | null Returns the underlying typeIds buffer, if the Vector DataType is Union. nullBitmap : Uint8Array | null Returns the underlying validity bitmap buffer, if applicable. Note: Since the validity bitmap is a Uint8Array of bits, it is  not  sliced when you call  vector.slice() . Instead, the  vector.offset  property is updated on the returned Vector. Therefore, you must factor  vector.offset  into the bit position if you wish to slice or read the null positions manually. See the implementation of  BaseVector.isValid()  for an example of how this is done. valueOffsets : Int32Array | null Returns the underlying valueOffsets buffer, if applicable. Only the List, Utf8, Binary, and DenseUnion DataTypes will have valueOffsets. Methods clone(data:  Data<R> , children):  Vector<R> Returns a clone of the current Vector, using the supplied Data and optional children for the new clone. Does not copy any underlying buffers. concat(...others:  Vector<T>[] ) Returns a  Chunked  vector that concatenates this Vector with the supplied other Vectors. Other Vectors must be the same type as this Vector. slice(begin?: number, end?: number) Returns a zero-copy slice of this Vector. The begin and end arguments are handled the same way as JS'  Array.prototype.slice ; they are clamped between 0 and  vector.length  and wrap around when negative, e.g.  slice(-1, 5)  or  slice(5, -1) isValid(index: number): boolean Returns whether the supplied index is valid in the underlying validity bitmap. getChildAt <R extends DataType = any> (index: number):  Vector<R>  | null Returns the inner Vector child if the DataType is one of the nested types (Map or Struct). toJSON(): any Returns a dense JS Array of the Vector values, with null sentinels in-place.","headings":[{"value":"Vector","depth":1},{"value":"Inheritance","depth":2},{"value":"Fields","depth":2},{"value":"data: Data<T> (readonly)","depth":3},{"value":"numChildren: number (readonly)","depth":3},{"value":"type : T","depth":3},{"value":"typeId : T'typeId'","depth":3},{"value":"length : number","depth":3},{"value":"offset : number","depth":3},{"value":"stride : number","depth":3},{"value":"nullCount : Number","depth":3},{"value":"VectorName : String","depth":3},{"value":"ArrayType : TypedArrayConstructor | ArrayConstructor","depth":3},{"value":"values : T'TArray'","depth":3},{"value":"typeIds : Int8Array | null","depth":3},{"value":"nullBitmap : Uint8Array | null","depth":3},{"value":"valueOffsets : Int32Array | null","depth":3},{"value":"Methods","depth":2},{"value":"clone(data: Data<R>, children): Vector<R>","depth":3},{"value":"concat(...others: Vector<T>[])","depth":3},{"value":"slice(begin?: number, end?: number)","depth":3},{"value":"isValid(index: number): boolean","depth":3},{"value":"getChildAt<R extends DataType = any>(index: number): Vector<R> | null","depth":3},{"value":"toJSON(): any","depth":3}],"slug":"arrowjs/docs/api-reference/vector","title":"Vector"},{"excerpt":"Types and Vectors Overview Usage Constructing new  Vector  instances is done through the static  from()  methods Special Vectors Dictionary Arrays The Dictionary type is a special array type that enables one or more record batches in a file or stream to transmit integer indices referencing a shared dictionary containing the distinct values in the logical array. Later record batches reuse indices in earlier batches and add new ones as needed. A  Dictionary  is similar to a  factor  in R or a pandas, or \"Categorical\" in Python.

To make it practical to work with these arrays in JS, some extra methods are added. toArray() :  Uint16Array Returns a zero-copy view of the underlying  Uint16Array  data. Note: Avoids incurring extra compute or copies if you're calling  toArray()  in order to create a buffer for something like WebGL, but makes it hard to use the returned data as floating point values in JS. toFloat32Array() : Float32Array This method will convert values to 32 bit floats.
