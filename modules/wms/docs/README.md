# Supported Standards

The `@loaders.gl/wms` module provides support for a subset of the OGC-standardized XML-based web mapping standards.

> The Open Geospatial Consortium (OGC) has produced a large set of related XML-based standards for web mapping. Some of these standards are not supported by loaders.gl, but are still mentioned here to provide context for the provided functionality (and minimize confusion as the standards have similar names and functionalities):

Support for the protocols is provided in the form of:

- a small collection of parsers for the XML responses from the various requests in these protocols.
- a short write-up on each protocol to indicate how to use loaders.gl to parse responses

Support for the GML format is provided as

- A standard "geospatial category" loader that converts the data into GeoJSON format.

## Installation

```bash
npm install @loaders.gl/wms
npm install @loaders.gl/core
```

## Attributions

`@loaders.gl/wms` relies heavily on `@loaders.gl/xml` to parse the XML heavy OGC standards.

Some test cases are forked from open layers, see license in test directory,
however no openlayers code is included in the published module, in order to
avoid downstream "binary attribution" requirements on loaders.gl users.
