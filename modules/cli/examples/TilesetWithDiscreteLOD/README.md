# Tileset with discrete LODs

## Description

The tileset contains three tiles each with a different decimation of the Stanford Dragon mesh.

- Root tile - highly decimated dragon
- Child tile - medium decimated dragon
- Grandchild tile - original dragon

When a tile's screen space error is met, it is replaced by its higher LOD child.
