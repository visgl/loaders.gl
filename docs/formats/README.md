# Overview

This file format documentation in loaders.gl is essentially a cleaned up collection of research notes for some of the formats supported by loaders.gl.  

The hope that by sharing these notes we may help some readers save time by providing a high level, easily digestible summary of the key points of specific file formats. 

However, please note that the docs in this "Formats" section are provided on an as-is basis, there is no currently no ambition to provide similar documentation for all covered formats.

Requesting maintainers to write new articles or update existing articles will likely not be successful. That said, egregious errors will be fixed if reported. GitHub Pull Requests with corrections or additional contributions are welcome, as long the proposed changes are reasonably consistent with the general style and level detail of the existing documentation.
