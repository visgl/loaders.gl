# Roadmap

## v3.x

loaders.gl is developed under open governance by multiple contributors.
White it is hard to catalog all ongoing work, current development tracks and aspirations include:

- New loaders: `GeoTIFFLoader`, `ZarrLoader`, `AVROLoader`,
- More comprehensive support for `options.shape` to control output format of loaders.
- More gLTF Extensions
- I3S: feature completeness and performance
- `ffmpeg` WASM integration for `@loaders.gl/video`
- EcmaScript module support
- Unbundled loaders.
- Replace `Schema` class with arrow schema if arrowjs tree-shaking improvements are satisfactory.
