# What's New

This page attempts to collect some of the relevant information about apache-arrow JS releases.
Unfortunately for JavaScript users, Apache Arrow JS release notes are not very easy to find:

- There are the [Apache Arrow release notes](https://arrow.apache.org/release/) where we can scan for issues with the `[JS]` tag.
- But there are also [blog posts](https://arrow.apache.org/blog/) that can contain different/additional information in the `JavaScript notes` section.
- And every minor release has its own page and blog, so users need to scan through a lot of docs to catch all changes.
- Additionally, the release notes are very brief, more of a PR title rather than a user facing description of what the change entails without reading the linked github issue.

:::caution
Apache Arrow JS follows the versioning number scheme for the cross-language Apache Arrow repository releases,
which results in frequent major release bumps, even though no significant or breaking JavaScript changes have been introduced.

This can be an inconvenience for JavaScript applications that rely on [semantic versioning](https://semver.org)
to restrict dependencies to compatible package. Therefore some extra attention around versions may be required,
especially if your app uses multiple JavaScript packages dependent on arrow. You may end up bundling two
different arrow js versions or the build may break due to version requirement incompatibilities.
