# Introduction

The Arrow JavaScript API is designed to helps applications tap into the full power of working with binary columnar data in the Apache Arrow format. Arrow JS has a rich set of classes that supports use cases such as batched loading and writing, as well performing data frame operations on Arrow encoded data, including applying filters, iterating over tables, etc.

## Getting Started

To install and start coding with Apache Arrow JS bindings, see the [Getting Started](docs/get-started).


## About Apache Arrow

Apache Arrow is a performance-optimized binary columnar memory layout specification for encoding vectors and table-like containers of flat and nested data. The Arrow spec is design to eliminate memory copies and aligns columnar data in memory to minimize cache misses and take advantage of the latest SIMD (Single input multiple data) and GPU operations on modern processors.

Apache Arrow is emerging as the standard for large in-memory columnar data (Spark, Pandas, Drill, Graphistry, ...). By standardizing on a common binary interchange format, big data systems can reduce the costs and friction associated with cross-system communication.
