The BSON ("Binary JSON") specification defines a binary format for storing JSON data in a more efficient and type safe way, including:

- associative arrays (also known as name-value pairs)
- integer indexed arrays
- a suite of fundamental scalar types.

## Data types and syntax

> The following information is heavily based on .

The topmost element in a BSON structure must be of type BSON object and contains 1 or more elements, where an element consists of a field name, a type, and a value. Field names are strings. Types include:

- Unicode string (using the UTF-8 encoding)
- 32 bit integer
- 64 bit integer
- double (64-bit IEEE 754 floating point number)
- decimal128 (128-bit IEEE 754-2008 floating point number; Binary Integer Decimal (BID) variant), suitable as a carrier for - decimal-place sensitive financial data and arbitrary precision numerics with 34 decimal digits of precision, a max value of approximately 106145
- datetime w/o time zone (long integer number of milliseconds since the Unix epoch)
- byte array (for arbitrary binary data)
- boolean (true and false)
- null
- BSON object
- BSON array
- JavaScript code
- MD5 binary data
- Regular expression (Perl compatible regular expressions ("PCRE") version 8.41 with UTF-8 support.

## EJSON (Extended JSON)

An important differentiator to JSON is that BSON contains types not present in JSON (e.g. datetime and byte array) and offers type-strict handling for several numeric types instead of a universal "number" type. For situations where these additional types need to be represented in a textual way, MongoDB's Extended JSON format can be used.

## Efficiency

Compared to JSON, BSON is designed to be efficient both in storage space and scan-speed. Large elements in a BSON document are prefixed with a length field to facilitate scanning. In some cases, BSON will use more space than JSON due to the length prefixes and explicit array indices.

## History

BSON originated in 2009 at MongoDB. Several scalar data types are of specific interest to MongoDB and the format is used both as a data storage and network transfer format for the MongoDB database, but it can be used independently outside of MongoDB.

Implementations are available in a variety of languages such as C, C++, C#, D, Delphi, Erlang, Go, Haskell, Java, JavaScript, Julia, Lua, OCaml, Perl, PHP, Python, Ruby, Rust, Scala, Smalltalk, and Swift.

## Example

A JSON "document" such as

```typescripton
{"hello": "world"}
```

will be stored as:

```typescript
\x16\x00\x00\x00          // total document size
\x02                      // 0x02 = type String
hello\x00                 // field name
\x06\x00\x00\x00world\x00 // field value (size of value, value, null terminator)
\x00                      // 0x00 = type EOO ('end of object')
```
