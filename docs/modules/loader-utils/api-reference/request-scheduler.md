</p>

The request scheduler enables an application to "issue" a large number of requests without flooding the browser's limited request queue.

A getPriority callback is called on all outstanding requests whenever a slot frees up, allowing the application to reprioritize or even cancel "issued" requests if the application state has changed.

Note: The request scheduler does not actually issue requests, it just lets apps know when the request can be issued without overwhelming the connection and the server.

A primary use case is to let the app reprioritize or cancel requests if circumstances change before the request can be scheduled.

## Usage

To schedule a request so that it can be issued at a time when it can be immediately processed.

```js
const URL = '...';
const requestToken = await requestScheduler.scheduleRequest(URL);
if (requestToken) {
  await fetch(URL);
  requestToken.done(); // NOTE: **must** be called for the next request in queue to resolve
}
```

## Methods

### constructor(options?: object)

- `id`?: string;
- `throttleRequests`?: boolean;
- `maxRequests`?: number;

### scheduleRequest(handle: any, getPriority?: () => number): Promise<{done: () => any)}>;

Called by an application that wants to issue a request, without having it deeply queued by the browser

When the returned promise resolved, it is OK for the application to issue a request.
The promise resolves to an object that contains a `done` method.
When the application's request has completed (or failed), the application must call the `done` function

Parameters

- `handle` an arbitrary handle to identify the request, e.g. a URL string
- `getPriority` will be called when request "slots" open up,
  allowing the caller to update priority or cancel the request
  Highest priority executes first, priority < 0 cancels the request

Returns a promise that

- resolves to an object (with a `done` field) when the request can be issued without queueing. The application should issue the request and call `done()` when completed.
- resolves to `null` if the request has been cancelled (by the callback return < 0).
  In this case the application should not issue the request.

## About Request Priorities

The `getPriority` callback controls priority of requests and also cancellation of outstanding requests.
