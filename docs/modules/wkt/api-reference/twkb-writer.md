## Installation

```bash
npm install @loaders.gl/wkt
npm install @loaders.gl/core
```

## Usage

```typescript
import {TWKBWriter} from '@loaders.gl/wkt';
import {encodeSync} from '@loaders.gl/core';

const geometry = {
  type: "Polygon",
  coordinates: [[[1, 2], [3, 4], [5, 6], [1, 2]]]
}
const arrayBuffer = encodeSync(geometry, TWKBWriter, {wkt: {hasZ: false, hasM: false}})
```

## Options

- `hasZ`: Should be `true` if the GeoJSON input has Z values. These values are expected to be the third coordinate position.
- `hasM`: Should be `true` if the GeoJSON input has M values. Thes are expected to be the third coordinate position if Z values do not exist, or fourth if Z values do exist.

## Format Summary

Well-known binary (TWKB) is a binary geometry encoding to store geometries (it
doesn't store attributes). It's used in databases such as PostGIS and as the
internal storage format of Shapefiles. It's also being discussed as the internal
storage format for a ["GeoArrow"](https://github.com/geopandas/geo-arrow-spec)
specification. TWKB is defined starting on page 62 of the [OGC Simple Features
specification](http://portal.opengeospatial.org/files/?artifact_id=25355).

- Coordinates can be 2-4 dimensions and are interleaved.
- Positions stored as double precision
