# TCX

- [TCX - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Training_Center_XML)

Training Center XML (TCX) is a data exchange format introduced in 2007 as part
of Garmin's Training Center product. The XML is similar to GPX since it
exchanges GPS tracks, but treats a track as an Activity rather than simply a
series of GPS points. TCX provides standards for transferring heart rate,
running cadence, bicycle cadence, calories in the detailed track. It also
provides summary data in the form of laps.
